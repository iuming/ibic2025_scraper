          "abstract": "In March 2025, the beam commissioning of the entire ESS linac commenced, supported by a diverse suite of instrumentation systems. This campaign followed the 2023 commissioning of the normal-conducting linac, which accelerated protons to 70 MeV. During the intervening period, the entire superconducting linac and the transport line to the tuning dump were installed. Several instrumentation systems underwent expansion, including the deployment of new position and phase measurement devices, current monitors, and beam loss detectors. In addition, various types of instruments saw beam for the first time, such as ionization profile monitors, fast wire scanners, beam stops, imaging systems, and an aperture monitor. The commissioning campaign culminated in the acceleration of first protons through the final drift tube linac tank (to 90 MeV), the superconducting spoke structures (to 216 MeV), and the medium-beta and high-beta elliptical structures (to >800 MeV). In this paper, we present the initial beam measurements, as well as verification of the protection functions and lessons learned from the experience.T.",

          "abstract": "(CCC) measures the intensity of particle beams via the azimuthal magnetic field. The superior performance of the CCC derives from a superconducting magnetometer (SQUID - Superconducting Quantum Interference Device), which detects fields in the fT range. This enables for current resolution in the nA range but in return needs extremely careful protection from external influences like stray fields and mechanical vibrations. The CCC therefore requires an elaborated superconducting magnetic shielding and is housed in a specially developed, vibration damped He bath cryostat. We have recently achieved half a year of non-stop operation in stand-alone (closed Helium circuit) mode. The nA resolution has been demonstrated earlier during several beamtimes, in CRYRING as well as with slow extracted beams from SIS18. Among the CCC types, which have been investigated, the 'Dual Core' (DCCC) version showed the best performance with respect to bandwith and current resolution. The DCCC and its cryostat therefore mark a provisional closure of CCC development for FAIR.

          "abstract": "essential devices for measuring bunched beam intensities in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). A cross-calibration of these devices against DC Beam Current Transformers (DC-BCTs) is used in the LHC ring, but this method relies on assumptions that introduce inaccuracies. FBCTs are also used in the LHC transfer lines, where DC-BCTs are unavailable, making absolute calibration crucial for transmission studies. To allow absolute calibration, the FBCTs are equipped with a pulsed current source to perform a calibration before each fill. However, a systematic underestimation in the calculated scaling factors has been observed when comparing them to the cross-calibration with the DC-BCTs. This work characterizes the calibrator performance, evaluates different algorithms for calculating the scaling factors and reports on issues found linked to processing chain modeling inaccuracies, ghost/satellite bunches, and the FPGA-based digital integration. A revised model of the processing chain improved calibration accuracy by 0.4%, while an initial test of a batch-by-batch baseline in the digital integration seems to explain the remaining 3% underestimation.J.

          "abstract": "crucial to the operation of X-ray Free Electron Laser (FEL) facilities such as LCLS-II and the future UK XFEL as the initial photoelectron phase-space distribution directly impacts x-ray generation efficiency in the undulator. Key photocathode parameters such as transverse emittance and quantum efficiency are routinely measured to monitor and improve performance; metrics that are influenced by the photocathode material, operating temperature, vacuum and RF environmental conditions, and the characteristics of laser illumination (e.g., wavelength, and pulse energy, duration, and repetition rate). To better understand these factors, SLAC has developed a laboratory-based cryogenic Momentatron system to measure the emission properties of photocathodes from 30 K to 300 K using 200-800 nm wavelength-tunable light. The system’s design and initial commissioning performance have been validated through simulations and error analysis, confirming its reliability for photocathode characterization. We present measurements taken at SLAC, along with complementary data for Cs-Te obtained using the TESS system at Daresbury Laboratory - a similar photocathode characterization tool. These results provide valuable insights into photoemission physics that may be leveraged to optimize photocathode performance and thus that of X-ray FELs., T. . Shan,  of Illinois ChicagoL.

The superconducting linear accelerator of the facility is intended to deliver a continuous-wave deuteron beam with an energy of 40 MeV and an unprecedented current of 125 mA. The production of neutrons is then achieved by driving the 5 MW beam into a liquid lithium target. Beam diagnostics play a critical role in the IFMIF-DONES accelerator due to several unique challenges. These include the extremely high beam power, the harsh environment due to neutron and gamma radiation and the required operational availability of the accelerator. Moreover, the accelerator may operate in pulsed and continuous wave for commissioning and standard operation, respectively. This work presents an overview of the main beam diagnostics techniques and strategies needed to address these challenges, as well as the construction plan and the prototyping works.

These components are the optics (mirrors, filters and optical fibres), the detector (a hybrid photomultiplier - HPM), the electronics (a Time to Digital Converter - TDC) and some data analysis used for the final results. Knowledge of the errors of the BSRL is crucially important as any errors are passed directly into the luminosity calibration of the LHC experiments. We quantify the errors introduced by each of these parts and for external systems, like the LHC timing.

          "abstract": "(ERLs) are a type of novel accelerator, which recycle energy from old beams to new beams to increase machine energy efficiency. However, this can heighten beam instabilities, which limits the maximum beam current and increases beam losses. An optical fibre beam loss monitor (OBLM) can provide rapid and reliable beam loss monitoring, which is important for mitigating these instabilities. It obtains the beam loss location via time-of-flight analysis of Cherenkov radiation (CR) produced in optical fibres by relativistic particle showers from beam loss events. Operational demonstration of the OBLM system has previously been shown at several non-ERL facilities, but the multi-energy, fast-repeating beams of ERLs present a unique challenge. Successful interpretation of ERL beam loss signals involves distinguishing losses from beams of different energies, which can be investigated through end-to-end Monte Carlo simulations of the radiation environment and its interaction with the OBLM system. This contribution presents Geant4 simulations of the OBLM response to sample sources of beam loss for beam energies of 7-500 MeV and bunch populations of 1-10M electrons., L. , University of LiverpoolJ.

Using transverse position, charge, and longitudinal phase information from 280 individual bunches collected by BPM probes upstream of the undulator, we successfully constructed a high-precision predictive model, demonstrating that BPM measurements can effectively predict the output laser power of the infrared FEL. Based on the trained predictive model, we further deconstructed the neural network architecture to accurately identify key bunches and sensitive parameters that most significantly influence laser power output. This provides a clear and targeted optimization basis for subsequent beam tuning experiments.

This paper focuses on the architecture of a novel data pipeline with implementations on monitoring the communication status between the 864 acquisition tunnel modules that digitize the analog loss measurements, and the 432 processing surface modules that determine and act upon the criticality of the beam losses. The discussed pipeline replaces an older batch Extraction-Transformation-Loading (ETL) process, which published daily BLM status reports, in favor of a streaming ETL process. The new pipeline expands beyond the daily publication of static status reports by exploiting real-time data analysis and processing enabling the live assessment of the system’s status via online fault detection and web-based dashboards. Future development on the implemented pipeline envisions online machine learning and automated Jira issue generation features permitting fault prognosis and issue tracking., , C.  10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-MOPCO05 03 Sep 2025 —  —  —",

Some of these CCs emit light in the red and green regions of the visible spectrum when optically excited with blue light. When a proton beam irradiates a LiF crystal, a volume distribution of CCs is formed, with defect concentration point-by-point proportional to the absorbed dose for values up to approximately 10^5 Gy. By illuminating the irradiated crystal with blue light in a fluorescence microscope, a luminescent image produced by the CCs can be observed and recorded. A high-resolution diagnostics both for spot imaging and energy in a proton accelerator has been developed based on this technique. Regarding energy, a luminescent replica of the Bragg curve in LiF is extracted and analyzed using a theoretical model of Bragg curve applied to dose deposition, taking into account the crystal dimensions. We report an application of this method to the 71 MeV TOP-IMPLART linac at ENEA Frascati, where it was used to evaluate the beam energy spectrum at both the crystal position and the accelerator exit.E. .

This study uses a low-energy x-ray imaging device designed to perform mobile digital tomosynthesis (DT), a modality of 3D x-ray imaging, for veterinary scanning to investigate the impact of this. An intentional offset is randomly applied of size 0.5 mm and 1 mm from the expected x-ray source position, and the quality of the reconstructed image is assessed for both the case where this offset is accounted for, and where it is not. From this, it is concluded that x-ray beams used for 3D imaging applications can have up to a 1 mm error without seeing large degradation in reconstructed image quality.ht be in other modern x-ray contexts, such as within XFEL technology.L. , University of LiverpoolC. , University of Liverpool, University of Liverpool; Cockcroft InstituteA.

This setup should allow to measure losses continuously over a large section of the accelerator, thus minimising the non-linearities caused by the finite coverage of the currently installed ionisation chambers. Due to the high radiation levels and low expected signals at this location, special care was taken during the procurement process to maximise the signal levels while at the same time extending the lifetime of the system as much as possible.

In April 2025, the nominal beam current of 400 mA was reached. In this contribution, we present the status and first beam commissioning experience with the RF System-on-Chip (RFSoC) based signal processing systems of the new SLS 2.0 ring. RFSoCs integrate several fast multi-GSample/s ADCs and DACs, FPGA (programmable logic) fabric and multi-core CPUs all on the same chip. During SLS 2.0 commissioning, the integrated EPICS IOC of the RFSoCs provided bunch-by-bunch diagnostics of dedicated BPM position and charge readings. Integrated DACs are driving newly developed transverse and longitudinal kicker magnets, enabling bunch-by-bunch excitation and damping. Bidirectional multi-Gigabit fiber optic links connect the RFSoC to the event system master, thus enabling both synchronisation of the RFSoC to the event system, as well as real-time control of the event system master by the RFSoCs, e.g. for control of beam injection timing and filling pattern.P.

This paper presents a simulation study investigating the feasibility of a cavity-based beam current monitor (BCM) for low-energy antiprotons. Conventional invasive methods, such as Faraday Cups and MCPs, suffer from charge loss, limiting measurement accuracy. This issue is particularly challenging for low energy charged antimatter, where accounting for charge loss is complex due to uncertainties in their interactions with matter. Existing techniques are reviewed and compared, and efforts to improve measurement accuracy within a tighter error margin than current methods are discussed. This study is motivated by challenges faced by antimatter experiments such as AEgIS at CERN, which aim to probe antimatter behavior under gravity. The preliminary results of the simulation and feasibility analysis of the BCM will be discussed., , C. , University of Liverpool, University of Liverpool; Cockcroft InstituteN. , University of LiverpoolB.

Proton beams in the range 1-6 MeV are available from a vertical delivery line placed at the exit of the injector, and at 63 MeV or 71 MeV (intermediate and lower energies are achieved by degraders) from a horizontal delivery line at the exit of the accelerator, where a pulse current variable up to 20 µA is provided in pulses 2.5 µs long at a typical repetition rate of 25 Hz. Our contribution presents the first experimental results from the commissioning of the high-energy line. It is a multi-purpose in-house designed line featuring a magnetic scanning system and a set of instrumentation, diagnostics, and target positioning frames placed on motorized platforms allowing for customizable irradiation setups. per le Nuove Tecnologie, l'Energie e l'Ambiente, ENEA Frascati Research CentreA.

The system uses a single 100m long thin silica fiber with photomultiplier tubes at both ends, allowing sensitive electronics to be located outside the radiation area. This design is favorable over bulky ionization chambers and more expensive scintillation-based detectors, as it improves and simplifies deployment in complex environments, particularly the ARIEL beamline tunnel. The prototype demonstrates sub-10 µs response times and position-sensitive detection via the time delay between upstream and downstream signals.

Special attention is given to the trade-off between device miniaturization and achievable field uniformity, a key factor in measurement sensitivity. Through computational modelling, we establish a framework for quantifying and optimizing magnetic field homogeneity, providing design strategies relevant for portable diagnostic instrumentation and potential applications where in-situ, non-invasive measurements are required.D. , University of LiverpoolC. , University of Liverpool, University of Liverpool; Cockcroft InstituteG.

This paper presents a lightweight, non-intrusive upgrade that replaces the legacy system with a web-based real-time streaming solution. By capturing the existing output from the measurement system and streaming it using standard web technologies, users can access beam size visuals on any browser-enabled device, gaining better image quality and improved stability while eliminating traditional broadcast maintenance. As TLS is scheduled to be decommissioned in 2027, this solution offers a fast, low-risk, and cost-effective modernization path without altering existing instruments or computing environments.

To understand and control the non-equilibrium beam dynamics at cSTART, various beam diagnostics with demanding specifications are required. The KARA booster has been used as an important tool to explore diagnostics for cSTART due to similarities in parameters, in particular the low electron beam energy (50 MeV) and the relatively high revolution frequency. Several beam diagnostics installed in the booster will be also installed in cSTART, i.e. the BPM readout electronics, the Bunch-by-Bunch (BBB) feedback system, the beam loss detection system, etc. In this context, dedicated beam time was used to test the performances of the different beam diagnostics systems, and to prepare for work around solutions in case of limitations if any. In this paper, we will describe the different experiments, emphasizing the procedures and highlighting the applied analysis.

To enable different spill durations ranging from nanoseconds up to several ms in an energy range of 0.8 to 3.2 GeV a fast extraction from the stretcher ring is developed. Therefore a repurposing of the existing injection kickers for extraction is under study to achieve single turn extraction, up to extraction within a few turns. While the effect on the beam dynamics is observed with a streak camera, the measurement of the extracted beam is performed via current and chromox monitors.

A rear-transition module (RTM) is being designed to interface with said embedded systems. In each of the four identical channels on the RTM, the differential signal from an alternating-current current transformer (ACCT) transimpedance amplifier will again be amplified by a differential operation-amplifier, then filtered by a low-pass topology. The conditioned signal is then digitized at a maximum of 10MS/s by an analog to digital converter (ADC) integrated circuit. After digitization, the ADC passes the data to an off the shelf AdvancedMC (AMC) Xilinx FPGA module using low voltage differential signals. This paper will describe the simulation of analog circuitry for signal conditioning, simulation of digital signal integrity based on physical design as well as verification of design characteristics critical to signal integrity. This work aims to create a methodology that can be applied to future RTMs requiring application of high-speed digital design principles., J.  10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-MOPCO40 29 Aug 2025 —  —  —",

In single-bunch mode, amplitude extraction via cross-correlation with a single response function yieds a turn-by-turn current relative resolution of 0.12%. By averaging over 200 turns, the resolution is improved to 0.04% at a 23 kHz data refresh rate, enabling fast and accurate lifetime calculations. However, in multi-bunch high-current mode, large longitudinal oscillations degrade the accura-cy of amplitude extraction when using a fixed-response function. We propose an integration method to mitigate the effects of bunch length and phase oscillations on beam current measurements. The method and experi-mental results provide a practical solution for machines exhibiting large longitudinal oscillations, such as HLS.A. , National Synchrotron Radiation LaboratoryX.

Furthermore, experiments conducted in fly-scan mode usually demand fast, high-precision low-level current measurements. To address these requirements, the development of a wide dynamic range ammeter (from 1 pA to 10 mA) has been addressed, based on a logarithmic transimpedance amplifier, eliminating the need for scale switching and featuring high precision and fast response. The proposed device converts the input current into a logarithmic output voltage and offers two operation modes: the logarithmic ammeter and the logarithmic ratiometer, both of which are particularly useful in X-ray spectroscopy experiments. This paper considers an overview of the device as well as its preliminary characterization and results, including logarithmic conformity, bandwidth, and noise., , P. .  10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-MOPMO05 03 Sep 2025 —  —  —",

The beam destinations were either Faraday Cups (FC) for the NCL commissioning or Insertable Beam Stops (IBS) for the SCL commissioning. Both FC and IBS are beam-intercepting devices, operated under vacuum, water cooled and movable by means of a pneumatic actuator. The **manufacturing** of FC and IBS relied on high-precision machining. The limited installation space and vacuum requirements required strict tolerances, complex welding of small components and vacuum brazing of compact cooling pipes. The **installation** of the devices themselves, their radiation shielding and portable cleanrooms were particularly challenging due to the limited space not only outside but also inside the beamline. The main challenge during the **operation** was posed by the beam power density. Radiation transport calculations allowed to minimize residual dose rates. Thermo-mechanical simulations allowed to define the operational limits thus avoiding damage to the beam destinations themselves and linac components nearby.E. .

As a result, it was possible to accurately quantify the beam power density within beam-interceptive devices and in turn their operational limits. Activation and 3D dose maps were computed and swiftly visualized in 3D, on top of the actual linac model.

To measure these losses, various detectors are used, primarily ionisation chambers (IC), but also other types of monitors depending on loss intensity. In injection and extraction areas, additional fast polycrystalline Chemical Vapor Deposition (pCVD) diamond detectors measure time structured losses. To increase sensitivity, a new detector, the cryogenic Beam Loss Monitor (CryoBLM), based on pCVD, was developed. It is mounted inside the cryostat between two superconducting magnets in the vicinity of the beam pipes and operates at cryogenic temperatures.

          "abstract": "accelerator at PSI mainly consists of several passive cavity type monitors and corresponding electronics. New VME based electronics are running in parallel for final online testing with the old CAMAC ones, which will be replaced soon. The new pre-amplifier of the VME system is suffering significant temperature-dependent drift, leading to an inaccurate measurement. Further, wrong transmission rate may lead to unexpected interlock and beam losses during operation. To address this issue many temperature compensation schemes were considered, numerous lab tests were conducted, eventually reach a temperature stabilization solution. Experimental validation demonstrates a factor of 4 reduction in temperature-induced measurement variance compared to previous implementation, achieving a temperature coefficient 166 ppm/degree for RF test signal. Furthermore, the new electronics incorporate a phase measurement of the 50.6 MHz proton bunches for beam energy monitoring. Beam tests show energy measurement consistency within ±0.15%. This implementation greatly facilitates the commissioning and status monitoring of the accelerator., , P. . , Paul Scherrer Institut 10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-MOPMO12 22 Aug 2025 —  —  —",

While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a path toward intelligent operator assistants, no single method is universally optimal. We present three use cases from PSI: for technical documentation, naive dense retrieval with summarization provides fast and interpretable access; for the AcceleratorWiki, a graph-augmented approach improves reasoning over hierarchies and cross-references; and for ELOG, an agentic pipeline with specialized agents supports multimodal interpretation, temporal reasoning, and iterative refinement.

If the evolution of beam parameters and beam loss during the injection transient process can be observed synchronously, analyzing their correlation can provide more quantitative guidance for further optimizing the injection process. To achieve this goal, a monitoring system capable of synchronously capturing the 3D position of each bunch and rapid beam loss has been established at the Hefei Light Source. Experiments investigated both TOP-UP injection and empty-ring injection processes. Thanks to the unique multi-parameter synchronous diagnosis capability of this system, some previously unnoticed special phenomena have been captured, and a deeper analysis of the correlation between bunch parameters can be conducted. TOP-UP mode exhibited maximum beam loss in the injected bunch, with secondary losses at the 14th subsequent bunch. Peak beam loss occurred immediately after injection in both modes, followed by rapid attenuation within several turns. Loss resurgence appeared after ~85 turns (TOP-UP) or 180 turns (empty ring), followed by oscillatory decay.Y. , University of Science and Technology of China, University of Science and Technology of ChinaY. , University of Science and Technology of ChinaY. , University of Science and Technology of China, National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, University of Science and Technology of China 10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-MOPMO16 31 Aug 2025 —  —  —",

The precise and reliable measurement of the neutron flux is not only relevant for the safe operation of nuclear reactors, but also for future reactor experiments essential for progressing the technology. In the presented work, simulations were performed using MCNP-6.3 to investigate the effects of various common reactor materials in different shield geometries on the performance of benchmark detectors. This was performed using a validated simulation of a 1 Ci Am/Be neutron source located at the University of Liverpool for a detailed experiment to simulation evaluation. The use of a conical shield/reflector material around the detector showed lower efficiency for the detection of thermal neutrons, and higher efficiency for the detection of fast neutrons when compared to the results for no additional material. The tailored measurement of neutrons of specific energies is highly relevant for reactor experiments on innovative technologies., ,  of LiverpoolC. , University of Liverpool, University of Liverpool; Cockcroft Institute 10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-MOPMO26 01 Sep 2025 —  —  —",

Extracted from the DAΦNE LINAC, the beam delivers up to 49 bunches/s, with 1 to $10^{10}$ particles/bunch. Secondary beams span 25-780 MeV (electrons) and up to 550 MeV (positrons). BTF includes two experimental halls: BTFEH1, suited for high-intensity and long-term experiments, and BTFEH2, optimized for lower intensities (up to 10⁶ particles/s). Both halls feature remote-controlled movable tables, beam diagnostics, and essential services like laser alignment, networking, high-voltage support, and gas pipelines, ensuring comprehensive experimental capabilities and 24/7 user support. A notable strength of BTF lies in the user-friendly approach: beam is easily manipulated to meet users' specific needs, even during ongoing data collection.

To deliver the beam to the ERL loop, a three-dipole merger with variable momentum compaction has been selected. At this energy, emittance growth is dominated by space charge effects, imposing strict constraints on the beam transport and diagnostic design. This study presents the design and optimisation of the diagnostic layout within the merger, taking into account instrumentation requirements, spatial constraints, and beam dynamics considerations.

Instrumentation will include a pepper pot emittance stage, quadrupole scan capabilities, profile measurements using screens and wire-scans or SEM grids, and bunch charge and energy spread determination. In a basic test environment, experiments were carried out at low accelerating voltages using a setup consisting of the dispenser cathode, a pickup anode, and a simple laser system with an optical shutter. The shutter enables alternating measurements of photocurrent and dark current at the anode, allowing first estimations of quantum efficiency. The influence of different cathode heating cycles on both the absolute quantum efficiency and its temporal stability was investigated with this setup.

Aging facilities such as LANSCE face an increased rate of equipment failures, resulting in costly unscheduled shutdowns for maintenance. Early identification and localization of problems along the accelerator can mitigate future failures during scheduled maintenance periods rather than emergency shutdowns. This approach will significantly enhance the facility's reliability and increase beam availability for users. We have developed a mathematical formalism to analyze all available data for a LANSCE subsystem and generate signals indicating abnormal operation. The system accounts for hidden internal correlations between various parameters, which the existing warning system does not. We report progress on developing an anomaly detection system for LANSCE by expanding predictions to all subsystems, increase LANSCE's data archiving capability by an order of magnitude, and developing algorithms to provide operators with signals indicating developing abnormalities and pinpointing problematic beamline elements., , , J.",

Installed in late 2024, these are the first devices tested at the facility. The goal is to condition the structures for stable operation at gradients of 100 MV/m. The maximum gradient is limited by electrical breakdown—vacuum arc formation under high electric fields—which interrupts RF transmission and can damage the structure. To study breakdown dynamics and validate models of their initiation, detailed, time-resolved charge measurements are needed. Faraday cups upstream and downstream, combined with high-performance 5 GS/s, 12-bit, 3 GHz FEB digitisers, enable precise characterisation of both dark and breakdown current emissions. Fast digitiser readout allows continuous acquisition at the 400 Hz repetition rate, capturing breakdown events and several hundred preceding pulses.

We have developed a cost-effective BLM system for the next-generation synchrotron light source, Korea-4GSR. The system uses plastic scintillators, optical fibers, and a CMOS camera to localize beam losses with 10 ms time resolution. Scintillators placed along the beam-line emit blue light proportional to the ionization energy deposited by beam losses. The light is transmitted through optical fibers, bundled into a 2D array, and imaged by a CMOS sensor at 100 Hz. The BLM’s sensitivity and calibration were verified using a 2 MBq Co-60 gamma-ray source. The preliminary result shows ~45 counts/GeV. Energy deposition was estimated using Geant4 simulations, and photon-to-count conversion was characterized with a calibrated LED source. The DAQ includes a built-in LED pulser for in-situ calibration of the CMOS detector and cable integrity check. This presentation outlines the system design, calibration methods, and performance results., , , , , , , , , S. .  10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-MOPMO37 07 Sep 2025 —  —  —",

          "abstract": "ring have been conducted as part of the ISIS-II proposal for a new high-power spallation neutron source. Beam stacking has been proposed to overcome space-charge limits in an FFA, and the feasibility of this will be evaluated in the FETS-FFA test ring by stacking up to four pulses at 50 Hz. To monitor the long-pulsed current of the coasting stacked beams over around 80 ms, the demonstration monitor of large-aperture Current Transformer (CT) with a Negative Impedance Converter (NIC) amplifier is being developed. NIC amplifier compensates the decay constant of the CT signal by cancelling the resistance of the wound coil. In addition to measuring long-pulsed coasting beam currents, the feedforward system is also added in NIC amplifier to boost the frequency band up to a few MHz to enable to measure accelerating bunch currents. This paper presents a design study of a CT monitor using a NIC amplifier and a feasibility test of a demonstration monitor detects long-pulsed signals (1s)., J. . , Osaka University 10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-MOPMO38 30 Aug 2025 —  —  —",

          "abstract": "ring have been actively performed to confirm the reliability of a Fixed Field Alternating gradient (FFA) accelerator for a future high-power spallation neutron source, called ISIS-II. A wall Current Monitor (WCM) is a choice of non-destructive intensity monitor to evaluate the circulating proton beams from 3 MeV (about 1MHz in revolution frequency) to 12 MeV(about 2MHz in revolution frequency) in the FETS-FFA test ring. As the beam orbit shifts radially with beam energy in FFAs, the aperture of FETS-FFA WCM will be about 700mm horizontally. The maximum mean circulating beam current is about 100mA and tomographic and Schottky measurements require a bandwidth of 370MHz (100 harmonics). This is a challenge for such a large monitor. A half-width demonstration WCM (demo-WCM) was designed and manufactured to benchmark numerical simulations and to understand monitor responses. Whilst measured frequency band was lower than expected, 1% intensity resolution was achieved in the demo-WCM. In this paper, the detail design study as well as the signal response of the demo-WCM will be presented., , K.  10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-MOPMO39 30 Aug 2025 —  —  —",

Combination of such characteristics opens an opportunity for cutting-edge high-resolution industrial imaging of dense materials: battery packs, historical artifacts and dynamic processes: crack propagation, motor engines running. The primary challenge in imaging with LWFA X-ray sources stems from shot-to-shot instabilities of flux, energies and pointing.

The collimators are located in sectors 37, 38, 39, 40, and 1. A fan-out kicker (FOK) system has been installed to reduce damage to the collimators during whole-beam loss events. Since APS-U began commissioning in April 2024, dozen of these events have taken place; in most, but not all cases, the FOK system has worked properly. Turn-by-turn beam position monitors provide beam centroid dynamics data during the loss events; however, limited diagnostics prevent in situ evaluation of the collimator beam-facing jaw surfaces. During maintenance periods in August 2024 as well as January and May 2025, some of the collimators were extracted from the vacuum chamber and examined. Faint beam strike damage was observed on the S01 collimator jaw, but more significant effects were seen on the S38 jaw. Measurements of beam motion during fast aborts is presented as well as microscopy images of the S38 damage. Coupled simulations results are compared with observations., , , , , W. .

The BTS BLM TOF system is comprised of a pair of rad-hard, fused-silica FO cables running along either side of the BTS line at beam elevation. In the initial configuration, we measured losses at both the upstream (US) and downstream (DS) ends of the FO cable pair. However, losses further DS along the septum and injection kicker set are also of interest. We therefore added a 20-m-length, multi-strand fused-silica FO cable bundle, replacing the DS outer FO radiator input. Thus, three of the detectors are configured at the US end of their respective FO radiators. The US detector location provides lower signal but improved spatial resolution over the DS. Loss location identification has been accomplished by inserting YAG screen flags at different positions along the BTS.

Noise from both high-frequency sources and low-frequency 60 Hz AC power equipment can contaminate the data. To suppress noise across these ranges—especially 60 Hz and its harmonics, which overlap with beam loss signal frequencies—advanced digital processing beyond standard filtering is required. Several real-time functional blocks were simulated and tested on an FPGA: (1) a dual time-constant discharging integrator filter, (2) a de-ripple baseline extraction and storage block, and (3) a fast-recovery discharging integrator. The nonlinear IIR integrator filter removes high-frequency noise and feeds into the baseline extractor. Upon detecting abrupt beam loss, it switches to a longer time constant to prevent baseline distortion. The de-ripple block calculates a valid baseline by averaging over multiple 60 Hz periods, storing results in a 4096-word FPGA RAM. This baseline is subtracted from raw data before integration by the fast-recovery block, which resets quickly after use. All blocks achieved expected performance and were successfully implemented on a low-cost FPGA., A.  10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-MOPMO45 30 Aug 2025 —  —  —",

Identifying parameters that affect beam quality and stability is important, but finding them among the vast number of parameters is not easy. In machine learning-based beam tuning, selecting the appropriate parameters for tuning is crucial, and another important issue is identifying factors that lead to beam instability. To address this, we have applied explainable AI techniques to analyze archived data and attempted to extract parameters that have a significant impact on the beam. This report also covers our data archiving system and analysis efforts using explainable AI., , , , M. , The Graduate University for Advanced Studies, SOKENDAIK. Kinoshita, , K. .

One of the most serious influences on beam dynamics was beam instability which has been clearly exhibited. The comprehensive experimental investigation of beam instabilities in BEPCII is an indispensable part of beam physics research and can provide references for the upgrade project of BEPCII. Over the past two years, the experimental investigation of beam instabilities in BEPCII has been carried on with the single and multiple bunch filling in the storage ring. With the optimization of the bunch-bunch feedback system, the designed collision luminosity , 1.0x10^33cm^-2s^-1 was achieved during the physical operation and the primary process on configuration of Feedback system will be introduced. For comprehensive understanding the feedback system, a physical model is developed and analysis is conducted to demonstrate the relationship between feedback capability and various parameters. This comprehensive physical model and analysis of the practical feedback system may provide valuable insights into the optimization of the feedback system. of High Energy PhysicsJ.

Proton beam intensity, the position and shape of the proton beam onto the target are important factors. Crucial for the efficient release of radioactive isotopes from a target are peak temperatures up to 2300 C and temperature gradients within. Since ISOL targets operate in a hard radiation environment conventional temperature diagnostics are not feasible. We have developed an optical system for remote temperature measurements in ISOL targets. It detects the emitted light of the hot target from a distance and correlates near infrared emissions (NIR) to temperature. The device includes a set of optics that transports the light to a NIR spectrometer, and the calculated target temperature is integrated into EPICS and MIDAS frameworks. The strength of the method is that no prior knowledge of the emissivity is required. The diagnostic guides on-line RIB delivery and supports R&D activities to optimize RIB production.

By integrating beam transport physics with neural networks, the method overcomes resolution degradation in low-data regimes. Numerical validations on a low-energy injector test platform demonstrate significant resolution improvements over algebraic techniques.

Space charge compensation (SCC) is a process that lowers the space charge of an ion beam by trapping either positive ions or electrons, created by interaction of the beam with residual gas. The compensating secondary particles reduce the beam potential and the space charge-induced divergence of the beam. Significant beam losses during SCC build-up necessitate minimising the SCC time of pulsed high-current ion beams. To address this, diagnostics techniques are used to study the SCC process and measure its degree or time. These techniques include emittance meters, beam profile monitors, wire scanners, retarding field analysers, and optical sensors. Such diagnostics are applicable to positive and negative ion beams, with unique challenges based on the specific ion beam and residual gas used. In this paper we review common SCC diagnostic techniques, discuss the differences in SCC diagnostics for continuous and pulsed beams as well as positive and negative beams, and highlight the importance of supporting particle-in-cell simulations., , , , , , , , K.  10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-TUDI01 03 Sep 2025 —  —  —",

It is therefore a potential candidate to complement the limitations of existing LHC transverse diagnostic systems. This contribution highlights the results obtained during the ongoing LHC Run 3. The instrument configuration has been optimized for best performance by combining observations in two spectral ranges of the fluorescence signal: a yellow range, originating from the fluorescence of neutral neon atoms, and a UV range, emitted by ionic neon species. The measurements are consistent with those from other profile monitors within operational requirements and allow real-time tracking of the average beam emittance.

In this work, a pulsed gas jet operation was proposed to minimize the introduction of gas molecules to the beam line and optimize the background pressure. The study was conducted on a gas curtain beam profile monitoring system using nitrogen gas. In this case, the pulse gas jet mechanism enables controlled gas injection into the multiple skimmer chamber to generate a supersonic pulse gas curtain. To achieve maximum current intensity and minimum chamber pressure, key parameters were optimized such as pulse duration or duty cycle, nozzle-skimmer distance, and inlet gas pressure. The results demonstrate a well-tuned pulse jet system can significantly reduce background and enhance the signal-to-noise ratio to monitor a pulse beam. The proposed study exhibits potential applications for beam diagnosis, especially for medical accelerators and laser based linear accelerators., O. , University of LiverpoolC.

          "abstract": "considered a driving force for emittance growth in high-intensity beams. To understand it, the emittance needs to be measured. In the past, the quadruple scan was one of the simple and efficient methods to measure beam emittance, but it is difficult to apply to high-intensity beams where the space charge plays a dominant role due to the deviation from the quadratic fitting. The tomography method was used before for this case to reconstruct phase space and then obtain the emittance, but the scan was time-consuming, and the post-analysis was very complex. One of the solutions is to use the genetic algorithm and treat this as an optimisation problem where the emittance needs to be optimised for the beam to match the quadruple scans. This method also involves heavy post-analysis, which limits its online application. In this contribution, machine learning methods will be used to reconstruct the phase space based on PIC simulations of space charge-dominated beams. of effectiveness of the machine learning method against the space charge level will be studied.,  of Liverpool 10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-TUPCO07 03 Sep 2025 —  —  —",

The stored beam current was reached 200 mA without the beam instability in July 2024. The stored beam current at user operation period was limited to 200 mA by the longitudinal instability.

To address this, a single multimode fiber (MMF) transmission system was previously tested to transport scintillation light from a screen to a remote camera. Because multiple guided modes are excited and coupled during propagation, the fiber output does not preserve the image and requires reconstruction. This contribution evaluates seven machine-learning reconstruction models for recovering the original transverse beam distribution from MMF output. Using data from the MMF-relayed Chromox screen campaign at CERN’s CLEAR facility, the study compares models in terms of reconstruction error, convergence speed, and run-to-run stability, with particular attention to the use of incoherent light.

In addition, muon identification must be performed in the presence of dark current from the accelerating structure. In this study, we are developing a beam position monitor that utilizes Cherenkov radiation to select the muon beam and measure its profile. To focus only the Cherenkov light originating from muons onto the light detection system, we have designed a beam profile monitor based on an Offner relay optical system, consisting of a convex and a concave mirror. This monitor enables the detection of ultra-low-charge muon bunches, which are extremely difficult to observe with conventional beam position or profile monitors.

Additionally, subsystems such as the corrector magnet power supplies and Beam Position Monitors, must comply with a stringent closed-loop latency of less than 100 microseconds. Initially, a 1 millimetre stainless steel vessel was deemed viable; however, experimental findings indicated that the combination of stainless steel and neighbouring copper vessels resulted in a decrease in both integrated magnetic field strength and system bandwidth.

The previous tube-based camera, used in a high-radiation environment, had limitations in sensitivity and resolution for continuous measurements. The upgraded design uses an innovative in-air light-emitting screen mechanically coupled to the AD target, monitored by a digital camera through a 20-meter optical line from a radiation-safe zone. This setup improves accessibility during beam operation and enhances measurement capabilities. Over two years of operation, several crucial modifications were made. A key change was transitioning from a scintillation material screen to an Optical Transition Radiation (OTR) screen, though this created new challenges with background interference. To address temperature-dependent calibration variations, an automated calibration mechanism was developed, utilizing advanced image analysis algorithms for real-time adjustments. This paper discusses these developments, challenges, solutions, and future optimization opportunities for the AD facility’s evolving experimental needs., , J.

Clinical studies have shown that to mitigate range deviations of the Bragg peak, safety margins of typically less than 5\\% around the target volume are employed. Consequently, real-time or online diagnostic techniques should be designed to minimize beam perturbation to the greatest extent possible. A minimally-invasive gas jet beam profile monitor for medical treatment facilities is being developed at the Cockcroft Institute (UK) to provide online monitoring. The monitor operates a thin, low-density, gas jet curtain, transecting with the beam. A proof-of-concept experimental study was carried out to quantify the degree of perturbation the gas jet has on a beam, using a 10 keV electron gun with a maximum current of ~100 μA. Any changes in beam profile and current were measured via a scintillator screen and Faraday cup respectively in path of the beam after the gas curtain. In the future, a simulation study will also be carried out using BDSIM, a Beam Delivery Simulation program built on GEANT4, with the experimental beam parameters along with medical hadron beams. This contribution provides the details of an experimental study into the perturbation experienced by an electron beam from a gas jet monitor.W. , University of LiverpoolN.

It is also widely used in beam diagnostics, for instance, in beam loss monitors or for bunch length measurements. In addition, it is of potential interest for transverse beam profile diagnostics as an alternative for standard techniques as scintillating screens and optical transition radiation. In this work, spectral and resolution properties of optical ChR were studied at the SINBAD ARES accelerator with an electron beam energy of 150 MeV. Several fused silica crystals of different thicknesses were used as radiators. They could be rotated relative to the beam, which allowed to investigate the angular dependency of the ChR spectrum which is quasi-monochromatic. The monochromatization effect arises from the frequency-dependent nature of the fused silica permittivity. In addition, the beam size dependency on the target angle was investigated in view of differences for various crystal thicknesses., , , , , -Synchrotron DESYA.  10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-TUPCO22 03 Sep 2025 —  —  —",

However, stable operation is hampered by a phenomenon known as Sudden Beam Loss (SBL), where beam instability occurs within tens of microseconds, resulting in significant beam loss and triggering a beam abort. It has been suggested that a fast increase in beam size may accompany SBL events. To study this rapidly evolving beam size instability and to gain deeper insights into SBL, we are developing a new bunch-by-bunch X-ray beam size monitor. It uses a silicon strip sensor to read the synchrotron radiation from the bending magnet and can record the transverse size of all bunches arriving at least 4 ns intervals.

We present a novel beam profiler based on silicon microchannels filled with scintillating resin, each individually read out by a photodiode array connected to custom microcontroller-based electronics. The 60 × 60 mm² sensitive area is modular and easily replaceable, addressing radiation-induced degradation over time. Designed as a plug-and-play solution for high-energy beamlines in particle therapy center, the compact detector achieves ~100 µm spatial resolution and is designed to reach profiling rates up to 4 kHz, although such rates are yet to be experimentally validated. Integration times are configurable between 20 µs and 1.4 s. Testing at CNAO with 70–230 MeV proton beams showed good agreement with reference detectors at low energies (&LT100 MeV), with a broadening effect observed at higher energies. This detector offers precise, high-rate beam characterization and is well-suited for commissioning and routine operation in a wide range of accelerator facilities.

A laboratory-scale replica of a beamline was constructed using an analog oscilloscope to emulate beam dynamics. Electrical actuation was implemented via deflection plates, while disturbances were introduced using an electromagnet. Beam position monitoring was performed through a 2×2 photodiode matrix, replicating the functionality of X-ray Beam Position Monitors (XBPMs). System identification through steady-state and transient analysis resulted in a first-order linear dynamic model relating input voltages to beam position. A PI controller was designed based on this model, and experimental validation demonstrated the controller’s effectiveness in maintaining beam stability under position drift conditions—typical disturbances during X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) experiments—achieving a control frequency of 1 kHz, limiting the steady-state error to below 0.2% of the total drift. The proposed approach provides a foundation for the development of high-performance control systems for synchrotron beamlines, with potential application to operational facilities.,  of Catania; STLab srl, STLab srl, University of CataniaG.

From previous studies, Carbon Nano Tube (CNT) wire is selected for the FETS-FFA WSM, durable for the heat damage of low-energy proton beams on the FETS-FFA test ring (3-12 MeV). A bias voltage, applied to the measuring wires, is required to prevent secondary electrons from returning to the wire due to the stray magnetic fields of the FFA main magnets. The endurance tests of bias voltages on different sizes of CNTs were performed prior to the beam tests on the Front-End Test-Stand (FETS) beam line and the FFA ring at KURNS. The beam tests with bias voltages on FETS and numerical simulations revealed secondary electrons from adjacent wires degraded the reading sensitivity, hence profile accuracy, explaining why the peak of the beam profile was not proportional to the wire size in previous studies. This paper will focus on the endurance test of bias voltages on CNTs as well as beam profile measurements with bias voltages on the FETS beam line. The mechanical design of the rig to install a thin CNT wire (diameter of 10 μm) on the frame head of FETS-FFA WSM will also be presented., A. .  10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-TUPCO39 30 Aug 2025 —  —  —",

          "abstract": "the J-PARC Hadron Experimental Facility449We have developed a highly sensitive beam profile monitor, the High-Gain Residual Gas Ionization Profile Monitor (HGRGIPM). The HGRGIPM detects electrons ionized by the proton beam in residual gas, which are guided by electric fields to a phosphor screen. The fluorescence is collected by an optical system. RGIPMs have proven to be powerful diagnostic tools for high-intensity beams because they have non-destructive nature. They have been used as the main profile monitors in the primary beamline, A-line (30 GeV, 83 kW, vacuum ~0.3 Pa). However, the newly constructed B-line (11 W) presents a significant challenge, as its beam intensity is four orders lower than that of the A-line. To overcome this issue, several improvements were made in the design of the HGRGIPM. These include the use of a thin phosphor screen to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, optimizing electrode geometry for higher acceleration voltages and improved sensitivity, and incorporating a high-efficiency optical system. These innovations allow profile monitoring even in the low-intensity B line. In this presentation, we report on the HGRGIPM's design and performance, beam response measurements, and future prospects., , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Y.  10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-TUPMO01 02 Sep 2025 —  —  —",

A new gas jet-based diagnostic system installed on the proton source provides non-invasive beam profile measurement * and allows a novel way for emittance evaluation with an additional mesh to create beamlets. The diagnostic uses a nozzle and skimmers to form a thin (~2 mm) and dense (10e17 1/m3) gas curtain of an interaction cross section of ~10x10mm2 inclined at 45° to the beam axis. A CMOS camera is installed to record the yielded photons (~s exposure time) from the interaction of the proton beam and gas curtain. It is crucial to use a gas that has a high collisional cross section (e.g. Ar, N or Ne) ** and is easy to distinguish from the residual gas (N) excitation to ensure effective detection. This study describes the optimization of the gas jet-based beam diagnostic including gas selection, jet formation (nozzle and skimmer design, curtain thickness and density) and vacuum system configuration.

As next-generation accelerators target higher brightness and lower emittance, conventional diagnostics may fall short. OSR, coupled with an optimized optical transport system, offers a scalable, high-resolution alternative. Using the Synchrotron Radiation Workshop (SRW) code, we model OSR emission and propagation through realistic optics, incorporating detector and transport effects. Feasibility of this emittance measurement study was assessed using a microlens array (MLA) system to capture angular beam distributions from OSR. To validate the imaging performance, we integrate SRW with optical ray-tracing simulations in Zemax. Successful reconstruction of the emittance and Twiss parameters from the simulated results in the end validate the framework’s accuracy in optimizing beam diagnostics. The method is benchmarked using beam conditions from the CLEAR facility at CERN, while also providing a blueprint for extending OSR-based emittance diagnostics to other facilities.D. , University of LiverpoolJ.

A non- invasive real time beam monitoring improves the efficacy as the dose is delivered in shorter time scales. To achieve this, gas-jet based Ionization Profile Monitor (IPM) is developed with potential capability towards real time beam monitoring. It detects ions produced by the interaction of primary beam with a thin (&LT1 mm) gas-curtain without perturbing the beam. This work presents the simulation of IPM to study the ion extraction under different configuration for accurate reconstruction of the beam shape. The role of electric field in the IPM on the trajectory of the ions and the inhomogeneity in their energy distribution affecting the beam profile are studied. The study also investigates the effect of beam misalignment, relative contribution of individual ion states generated due to interaction, and the gas-curtain density distribution.

To obtain a beam profile quantitatively, we have also devised a beam reconstruction method with a response function measurement method. These methods gave a 2-D beam profile of a high-intensity 3 MeV beam at the J-PARC RFQ test stand, which well agreed with a simulated 2-D profile by a particle-in-cell code and 1-D profiles measured by a wire-scanner monitor. As the next step, measurement of a 400 MeV hydrogen negative ion beam at the end section of the J-PARC Linac was challenged. Since a high-energy beam rarely interacts with a gas due to the small cross-section and induces an intense radiation noise, the captured image had a very low signal-to-noise ratio though the beam-induced signal was detected. Through some measurements, it was found that the primary noise was a radiation directly acting on a built-in multi-channel plate of an image intensifier.

FLASH radiotherapy has shown a strong potential in improving treatment effectiveness by delivering doses at ultrahigh dose rates (>40 Gy/s). Beam monitoring at FLASH is challenging, as existing devices like Ionization chambers face saturation. We are developing an all-optical monitor for real-time transverse beam profile measurements in the treatment beam delivery zone. As the therapeutic beam must inherently traverse the ambient air path from the nozzle to the patient, the monitor passively captures beam-induced fluorescence along its trajectory without affecting the beam.

However, while reducing the vertical emittance from the SOLEIL's nominal 50 pm.rad value to 8 pm.rad, unexpected filaments were observed in the image plane of the pinhole cameras, severely spoiling the reliability of the emittance measurement. Investigations, on the existing pinhole cameras as well as on the Metrology beamline of SOLEIL, revealed that those filaments correspond to a phase contrast imaging of the UHV Aluminium window, located before the pinhole.

With an increase in beam intensity following the PIP-II upgrade at Fermilab, the beam losses are expected to be higher with some coming from beam halo. Therefore, it is important to measure the sources of beam halo to minimize the beam losses. A modified Halo Monitor developed by J-PARC will be installed in Fermilab MI-8 transfer line to measure the beam halo. In this paper, an update on the beam profile monitor fabrication is covered. The updates include the location selection for the Halo Monitor in the MI-8 transfer line, shielding options for instrumentation, initial testing of equipment, and ray tracing simulations for the Offner optics and the targets used in the monitor.B. , Illinois Institute of TechnologyR.

Carbon Nanotube (CNT) wires offer a promising alternative to traditional carbon fibre scanners due to their lower density, improved thermal properties, and reduced beam interaction. This work evaluates the performance of CNT wires in beam halo diagnostics, focusing on their energy and intensity range, durability, and operational feasibility. Preliminary results show that CNT wires provide better contrast and lower beam perturbation, with enhanced thermal stability under HL-LHC conditions. However, sudden temperature increases lead to significant shape deformation due to catalytic particles sublimating. We discuss challenges in manufacturing, post-processing, and limitations related to wire diameter and density. While CNT wires show strong potential for next-generation scanners, further studies are needed to optimise long-term performance.-Cervera, , R. .

Several systems will be presented. A first PEPITES profiler was installed at ARRONAX`**` in May 2022 and is used routinely. It features a 10 µm Water Equivalent Thickness (WET) and two 32-strip 7×7 cm² planes to sample the beam along X and Y, each facing a positively biased plain electrode to collect the electrons. A second monitor is under development with CNAO`***` for therapeutic beams. Its lower, 5 µm WET, is motivated by the long 6.5 m patient-monitor distance and is obtained by replacing the anode plans by off-axis metallic bars.

The new system is built with state-of-the-art digital signal processing circuits based on the MicroTCA.4 standard. The stored beam’s closed orbit distortion (COD) is measured at a 10 kHz rate using the circuits matched to the number of BPMs, and corrected to a designated reference orbit by feeding back the results of matrix calculations using the inverse response matrix to the currents of fast steering magnets. The transition from the legacy VME-based system, which had been in service for nearly 30 years, was carried out carefully and stepwise during the startup phase of the third operation period. The reference orbit was successfully transferred to the new system, and even in-vacuum undulators with a minimum gap of 4 mm were operated without requiring additional orbit corrections.

          "abstract": "accelerators. Which RF frequencies need to be shifted is highly facility dependent, which demands a wide range phase shifter. The phase shifter presented in this contribution consists of a custom board, that includes a high-performance quadrature modulator, voltage regulators and an 16-bit digital-to-analogue converter that offers an I2C interface. The quadrature modulator is specified to work in the frequency range between 50 MHz and a 6 GHz. The board is combined with commercial off-the-shelf products to provide a software interface and a RF tight compact housing. We present amplitude and phase noise measurements and amplitude stability measurements. At the ELBE Center for High-Power Radiation Sources we use the phase shifter to shift the phase of the superconducting RF gun laser with respect to the accelerator cavity RF field. This allows to implement a feedback loop that stabilizes the THz output power of the THz undulator source at ELBE. In order to achieve this, the beam position is monitored in an energy dispersive beam line section and the gun laser phase is used to keep it constant., , , R.

Ground vibrations originating from both natural and artificial sources can significantly impact the stability of critical components, particularly the accelerator and beamline elements. To assess the potential influence of these vibrations, we conducted comprehensive ground vibration measurements at the Korea-4GSR construction site. This study was performed with the sensitive accelerometer at various locations across the construction site to characterize the amplitude and frequency content of the ambient vibrations. The collected data were analyzed to evaluate the potential impact on the beam stability, considering the vibration tolerance levels of key accelerator components.

In low-emittance storage rings, however, the power density of the photon beam has increased, making it challenging for conventional profile monitors such as wire scanners and scintillating screens to withstand the high power without damage. Here, we present the development of an Ionization Profile Monitor (IPM) capable of robustly measuring the photon beam position and enabling non-destructive beam profile measurement. A noble gas environment was designed to ensure sufficient ionization signal strength, and a defocusing electrode structure was introduced to fully utilize the relatively large active area of the readout system. Since the magnification induced by the defocusing field depends on the vertical position, we proposed a calibration method to correct for the resulting non-linearity.

The toolkit's unique capabilities are further demonstrated through three key applications: modeling complex mask instead of double-slit interferometers, simulating X-ray pinhole camera with more precise pinhole structure, and analyzing the impact of thermal-induced wavefront distortions on beam profile characterization. HALF's X-ray pinhole camera and interferometry-based dimension measurement subsystem require this toolkit for optimized design.

Ion-collecting IPMs are susceptible to significant distortions in the measured beam size due to the space charge of the passing beam. Conversely, electron-collecting IPMs are much less affected but can only be operated periodically to preserve sensor lifespan. In this work, WarpX simulations of IPM operation are used to characterize the measured beam size as a function of circulating beam parameters and IPM operating conditions. We then study the efficacy of integrating machine learning models into the beam size prediction algorithm to generate a better emittance measurement. We consider both supervised and unsupervised approaches. The former utilizes simulations to back out the contribution of space-charge when the ions drift from their point of origin to the collection rods.

The method relies on diffracting the emitted X-ray radiation off a water suspension of spherical nanoparticles, which however pose several limitations for the full exploitation of the technique during normal operations.

This EO-BPM has been installed in the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) since 2024. The Pockels effect in lithium niobate crystals is exploited to detect the propagating electric field from passing proton bunches, enabling measurement of beam position and intra-bunch instabilities. Light is conveyed from a remote laser via optical fibres to a Mach-Zehnder interferometer formed between two waveguide pick-ups. The rapid response of the EO-BPM enables intra-bunch turn-by-turn measurements. Data recorded over a range of beam conditions have been studied to characterise its performance, stability, and sensitivity. This paper presents the latest data collected from the SPS and discusses the analysis and future development of the EO-BPM., S. . Arteche  Instituto de Física de CantabriaD. .

This tutorial explores orbit stability, covering sources of perturbations like magnet misalignments, ground vibrations, and power supply fluctuations, as well as correction algorithms used to mitigate their effects. One focus of the tutorial will be on advances in simulations, which have played a crucial role in optimizing the design and performance of subsystems as well global mode space analysis. Various correction techniques, including slow and fast orbit feedback systems, beam-based girder alignment, and the integration of XBPMs into the electron beam control system, will also be discussed to improve long-term beam stability and performance. Real-world examples from leading 4th-generation facilities will highlight how advanced orbit control strategies and cutting-edge hardware have enabled the achievement of remarkable orbit correction bandwidths, significantly enhancing electron beam stabilityS.

In order to clean beam halo particles and avoid quenching the LHC superconducting magnets, the novel crystal collimation method employing 4 mm-long crystals was introduced for ion operation in the LHC Run 3. The LHC Beam Loss Monitoring (BLM) system triggers the beam dump in case the measured losses are above certain predetermined thresholds. Important adjustments were needed in order to optimize these thresholds in accordance with the peculiar loss pattern produced by crystal collimation.

A further upgrade next year will double the energy and power. Machine protection at this extremely high power required a novel system of fast beam-loss monitors (BLMs). Points of concern, such as collimators or kickers, are covered by diamond detectors (PBLMs). Long optical fibres (LBLMs) of up to 200 m span the entire 4-km facility, generating and capturing Cherenkov emission from beam-loss showers. Previous papers have reported on the design and early commissioning of this safety system, and on plans to use the loss signals for wire scanners and loss localisation. Subsequent experience in commissioning and operating the full system has demonstrated that the concept is sound and sensitive, but several aspects of the implementation have proven troublesome. Extensive testing and debugging uncovered issues with both hardware and firmware.

Elucidating SBLs, which can cause extensive damage to accelerator components and the Belle II experiment detectors, is a pressing issue for SuperKEKB. To measure the beam size and position variation, key information for disentangling SBLs, over dozens of turns just before the SBL-induced beam aborts, we have developed new turn-by-turn beam size monitors in two different wavelength regions, X-ray and visible light, and bunch-by-bunch beam position monitors where one has utilized a novel architecture AMD/Xilinx RFSoC. Simultaneous measurements of turn-by-turn beam size and bunch-by-bunch beam position enable elucidation of the cause and time evolution mechanism of the SBL events. In this presentation, we will first introduce recently developed fast beam size and beam position monitors, then show their simultaneous measurements of SBL events.

Each fork hosts two perpendicular wires, allowing for the reconstruction of the beam profile in both the x and y directions. The wires are 2,4 and 6 µm wide and only 200 nm thick, and their length is tailored to match the SwissFEL beam clearance. Several prototypes have been successfully produced and installed at SwissFEL.

This source was installed and characterized at the ATF2 facility in KEK, Japan. The system injects tailored RF pulses into the BPM cavity via one of the two output ports present for each axis. With the capability to adjust frequency and pulse width, to emulate beam pulses, the system demonstrated nearly complete cancellation of beam-generated signals when the injected RF pulse overlapped with the beam pulse. This source has the potential for in-situ BPM calibration without relying on motion systems or \"dog-leg\" orbit bumps. Beyond calibration, it provides a method to mitigate static signal contributions caused by cavity misalignments and shows potential for compensating wakefield effects, offering a versatile tool for improving beam diagnostics and accelerator performance.K. .

          "abstract": "such as gold meshes and conductive diamond films, often suffer from significant drawbacks, as diffraction effects, non-uniform transparency, low signal levels, and poor spatial resolution, particularly when applied to soft and tender X-ray beams. To address these limitations, we explore the use of ultra-thin (&LT2 µm) free-standing Silicon Carbide (SiC), developed by SenSiC GmbH, membranes as in-line, minimally invasive beam position monitors*. These devices offer high lateral resolution and minimal beam perturbation, making them particularly suitable for synchrotron radiation applications. Preliminary beam tests were conducted at the NanoMAX beamline (MAX IV) using highly focused (&LT1 µm FWHM) soft X-ray beams. SiC devices with 4-quadrant layouts demonstrated clear beam detection capability, though limitations emerged at the quadrant interfaces due to charge collection losses and charge multiplication under high electric fields. These effects were further investigated using Sentaurus TCAD simulations, which highlighted the potential for optimized sensor geometries to mitigate such issues. Results from a related SiC membrane intensity monitor, tested at the PTB four-crystal monochromator beamline at BESSY II demonstrated compatibility with tender and hard X-rays**. This device features a 3 mm diameter membrane consisting of a 0.3 µm p⁺ layer, 1.5 µm n⁻ active region, and a 370 µm n⁺ substrate, with Al contacts. Transmission tests in the 1.75 - 10 keV range confirmed excellent transparency (up to 97.55%) and uniform photocurrent response under 8 keV raster scans. The measured photocurrent at zero bias was 0.586 nA with 86% charge collection efficiency. Together, these results highlight the promising role of sub-2 µm SiC membranes for high-precision, in-line monitoring of X-ray beams across a wide spectral range, with ongoing developments targeting even thinner devices for optimized performance in soft X-ray applications.

This is equally true in novel plasma accelerators and for free electron lasers. The gold standard for such measurements is the transverse deflecting cavity (TDC); however, these devices are typically invasive and costly to produce and operate. As an alternative, a THz-based reflective imaging system has been designed and installed at the MAX IV short pulse facility (SPF) for imaging coherent transition radiation (CTR) for bunch profile reconstruction. This contribution presents the progress towards applying transfer learning to deep learning models for evaluating the reconstruction of bunch profiles from experimentally acquired CTR images, building on previous successes in profile prediction using simulated data. Practical resolution limits and the next steps in the development of the monitor are also discussed, where the reconstructions of the longitudinal profile will be achieved using single-shot CTR images and benchmarked against the TDC bunch profiles.A. , University of LiverpoolC.

The combination of XBPM and upstream/downstream EBPM readings of the insertion device enables verification of the photon beam’s alignment along the correct trajectory. Significant changes in the beam position or profile, as well as prolonged periods without recalibration, may cause the XBPM measurement data to lose its reliability. Therefore, evaluating the reliability of the XBPM measurement data is of critical importance. By analyzing the deviation between the theoretical and measured blade intensities and calculating the standard deviation of the similarity percentage among the four blades, a reliability indicator is established.

To monitor the beam energy and its spread, magnetic dipoles and quadrupoles will be installed along the linac, together with viewing screens and CCD cameras. Macroparticle beam dynamics simulations were performed to determine the optimal energy measurement setup in terms of accuracy and resolution.

Accurate alignment of a BPM with the center of the neighboring magnet is imperative, a critical requirement for SPring-8-II. With a total of 340 BPMs, efficient beam commissioning of SPring-8-II necessitates a fast beam-based alignment (BBA) method. To assess the feasibility of this method, we conducted a fast BBA experiment at the current SPring-8 storage ring utilizing new BPM readout electronics based on MicroTCA.4, enabling a data acquisition rate at 10 kHz. We varied the strength of a quadrupole magnet adjacent to a BPM head connected to the new fast readout. We scanned the electron beam across the quadrupole center by adjusting a steering dipole magnet. The BPM offset from the quadrupole center was then determined by analyzing data from all BPMs connected to the fast readout. This contribution will detail the proposed fast BBA procedure for SPring-8-II and present the results obtained from the feasibility test at the existing SPring-8 storage ring.

To precisely measure the transverse beam position during injection, painting, and storage in the Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS), a large-aperture (260 mm × 180 mm) Beam Position Monitor (BPM) is essential. The rectangular cut-plane BPM was selected for its excellent linearity over a large area and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Due to limited space in the injection section, the BPMs must be integrated into the AC steering magnet. To prevent thermal heating from eddy current flow, a rib structure has been incorporated into the BPM's outer body. The BPM was designed using numerical simulation codes and subsequently manufactured.

At the RIKEN Nishina Center, various ion beams are accelerated using linacs and cyclotrons. However, the beams handled are slow enough compared to relativistic speeds, the bunch length is only about the same as the electrode size, and the beam diameter may be close to the electrode spacing. Conventional “diagonal cut” or “cosine two-theta cut” (for quadratic moments) BPMs produce deviations in wave height*. To solve this problem, it is expected that the wave height deviation can be eliminated by cutting the electrode in a spiral shape. Furthermore, by cutting in a spiral shape, multiple cuts can be placed in one BPM, and it is expected that beam intensity, horizontal position, vertical position, and second moment can be read out at a single location.

Beam collimation prior to the system affects measurement accuracy. For electron injectors operating at a few MeV, a high-precision spectrometry system based on the magnetic deflection method is developed, and an energy spectrum model is established to study the design and magnetic field optimization of the key dipole magnet (D-magnet) as well as the influence of upstream beam collimation on beam trajectory accuracy. Simulation results indicate that the optimized D-magnet enhances performance, and beam collimation analysis verifies effective trajectory control, improving system precision and providing technical support for high-precision energy measurements., , , , , , T. .

This design allows operating in parallel with the FEL2, minimizing time jitter with respect to the seed laser which is the main time marker of the FEL process by removing the time jitter contributions related to the use of an external laser. In our setup a fraction of the energy from the seed laser amplifier is extracted and delivered via a dedicated low vacuum transport system to the EOS setup in the tunnel with beam pointing stabilization actively obtained by piezo actuators. The laser beam size, pulse compression management, polarization cleaning and selection are performed in the tunnel prior to injecting the laser beam in the vacuum chamber. The spatial encoding scheme is employed, with a 100-micron thick GaP crystal and a detection performed in cross polarizers setup using a CMOS camera. The EOS has been characterized in terms of temporal resolution, jitter and drift. Finally, its capability to operate as longitudinal feedback system is also reported., , , , , , , , , , , , , , -C.p.A. 10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-WEPCO16 03 Sep 2025 —  —  —",

Commercial products are available in different materials, such as diamond (CIVIDEC, DECTRIS) and Silicon Carbide (SenSiC GmbH)*. One issue related to this class of devices is the presence of a separation cross in the center of the device, used to obtain four independent diodes to reconstruct the position of the beam. When dealing with monochromatic highly focused beams, diffraction effects could occur. To overcome this issue, a device inspired by Position Sensitive Diodes (PSD) is currently under study by SenSiC. This device, named “resistive-XBPM”, consists of a thin (1 um – 10 um), 5mm wide, 4H-SiC single-crystal free standing membrane. An additional thin resistive layer allows, for the four metallic contacts on the edges of the device, to collect charge which is proportional to the position of the beam onto the surface of the device. A dedicated electronic system has been optimized to have the simultaneous reading of the four channels, thus achieving real-time reconstruction of the beam position without the limits of the “standard” XBPM-type sensors.

Leveraging *internal photoemission*, these sensors can give critical advantages over conventional metal-based blade monitors that rely on *surface photoemission*[1]. Notably: (i) *semicon-sensors* generate signals up to three orders of magnitude higher, unaffected by surface contamination; (ii) they can intrinsically suppress low-energy background from bending magnet radiation, greatly improving signal fidelity[2]; (iii) through a novel optimization strategy termed *harmonic-tuning*—which uses spectral filters to selectively enhance detection of specific harmonics from insertion devices—*semicon-sensors* can achieve up to 10× superior spatial resolution. These capabilities enable precise, stable beam diagnostics upstream of monochromators in modern 4th-generation synchrotron facilities. At the conference, we will present comparative modelling results across multiple beamlines, facilities and gap/K-values, demonstrating/establishing performances gains. Furthermore we will present first experimental results of these sensors tested at the Swiss Light Source (SLS) in Switzerland and at IHEP synchrotron in ChinaM.

However, limited working distances in STXM setups restrict the integration of conventional diagnostics. To address this, we have developed a center-stop-based Silicon Carbide (SiC) device that integrates beam position sensitivity directly into the optical path, by functionalizing the order sorting aperture (OSA). The device was fabricated from a 20 µm thick single-crystalline SiC membrane using plasma focused ion beam (PFIB) lithography, enabling accurate microstructuring while preserving front-side electrode integrity. Live recording of beam position and I₀ during measurements is enabled through the 4-sector diode geometry patterned around the center stop. Validation experiments at the PolLux beamline (Swiss Light Source) demonstrate the device’s suitability for real-time correction of beam-induced artefacts in next-generation STXM.

Using custom processing and assembly methods, BIS devices achieve ultra-compact footprints below 1 mm and are designed for both real-time intensity monitoring and four-quadrant beam position sensing. The choice of SiC enables extreme radiation hardness and intrinsic insensitivity to visible light, enhancing sensitivity and signal fidelity by suppressing stray light contributions. BIS sensors have been successfully validated in operational environments: intensity-monitoring devices were tested at the SLS, while position-sensitive variants were deployed at MaxIV. These results demonstrate the robustness and precision of the BIS technology, offering a compact, radiation-resistant solution for integrated beam diagnostics in high-brilliance synchrotron beamlines.

SuperKEKB will operate at unprecedented luminosities requiring very high beam currents. To reach and maintain such currents, high injection efficiency is essential which in turn requires precise tuning of the injection process. The RFSoC based BPM will provide a highly flexible platform for beam orbit measurements near the injection point required for the tuning. One objective is to enable the separate resolution of the orbit of both bunches in the two-bunch injection mode, where two bunches are accelerated and injected with 96 ns spacing.

The most common technique, EO spectral decoding (EOSD), is favoured for its simplicity, reliability, and straightforward output interpretation, however its resolution is constrained to the geometric mean of the transform-limited and chirped probe laser durations. We have introduced a new technique utilising spectral interferometry (EOSI), which overcomes this limitation by adding a single optical element to an EOSD setup, with successful measurements shown previously on the CLARA accelerator at Daresbury Laboratory. To further explore this technique, we have performed EOSI on the CLEAR accelerator at CERN (160-200 MeV, 15-150 pC and 0.2-1.5 ps RMS) utilising a nJ oscillator and optical fibre-coupled transport. Our results highlight the potential for low power, turn-key operation and flexible integration of EOSI systems for single-shot ultrashort bunch length and arrival time monitoring., T. .

          "abstract": "Source711Steady-state microbunching (SSMB) is a proposed scheme to generate coherent radiation at short wavelengths from a microbunched electron beam in a storage ring. The feasibility of the idea is investigated in an ongoing proof-of-principle (PoP) experiment conducted at the Metrology Light Source (MLS). Phase I of the SSMB PoP experiment has been using an experimental setup employing a single-shot modulation laser to show the general viability of the idea, and has explored the underlying complex storage ring dynamics. The next step in the SSMB PoP campaign is to progress from the single-shot setup of phase I towards quasi-steady state. To this end, a new laser system is installed at the MLS that can provide turn-by-turn modulation of the electron beam for 1000 revolutions. The main goal of this phase II of the SSMB PoP experiment will be to show bound motion of electrons within individual laser-induced microbunches. In this paper, we show the progress of preparation for PoP phase II, with emphasis on the setup and integration of the new laser system and diagnostics challenges., , , -Zentrum Berlin für Materialien und EnergieX.

The Smith-Purcell radiation mechanism has been studied for the case of metallic gratings, but not much experimental data has been published yet with respect to dielectric gratings as charged particle beam diagnostic devices. We expect a number of advantages in the detection of the radiation at the substrate side and the spectral properties of the radiation tailored by the geometric shape of the grating structures. Due to the advances in lithographic techniques dielectric gratings can be produced with optical wavelength periodicities and the shapes can be controlled with nano-meter precision. For femto-second bunch lengths the coherence of transition radiation starts to reach the near-infrared to optical regime. This opens up the possibility of characterizing the spectrum with readily available high sensitivity semi-conductor based detectors to draw conclusions on the form factor and measure bunch lengths.,   Universität Hamburg, Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY, Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY; Universität HamburgW.

The 20 GeV/c proton beam from CERNs Proton Synchrotron (PS) hits the Pb-spallation target with a nominal intensity of 8.5e12 protons/bunch, a proton bunch length of 16 ns FWHM and a maximum repetition rate of 0.8 Hz.

The proton beam position is measured using a SEM grid 2 m before the spallation target. A linear correlation between the horizontal proton beam impact position on the Pb-target and the measured dose of the secondary radiation at the measurement station for each pulse is observed. While the proton beam impact position varies by 12 mm, the normalised dose varies by 20%.

Traditional XBPM designs typically feature four tungsten blades arranged at the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the white beam. However, the high absorption and lower thermal resistance of tungsten limit the proximity of the blades to the X-ray source, which may negatively impact measurement precision. This study investigates the performance of an innovative XBPM design that utilises silicon carbide (SiC) blades, which provide enhanced thermal conductivity and reduced absorption. This advancement may allow for closer placement of the blades to the beam, potentially improving measurement accuracy. This experimental setup aims to assess the impact of SiC blades on measurement accuracy, signal-to-noise ratio, and linearity compared to conventional tungsten XBPMs. The results will offer valuable insights into the benefits and limitations of SiC-based XBPMs compared to their tungsten counterparts., L.  10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-WEPMO05 03 Sep 2025 —  —  —",

To enhance the accuracy of position and angle measurements of the synchrotron radiation beam at SPring-8 BL15XU, both a quadrant-type XBPM and a fixed-blade XBPM were installed on the same beamline. In the quadrant-type XBPM, widening the detector spacing led to noticeable X-Y coupling. To address this, a 2×2 correction matrix was introduced to perform linear transformation of the measured signals.

As non-invasive diagnostic devices, beam position monitors (BPMs) are the main “workhorse” in accelerators, providing beam center of mass position information. The position conversion factor (K-factor) of BPM systems constitutes a fundamental determinate of measurement accuracy. While precision calibration traditionally relies on moveable calibrate platforms, the prohibitive cost of equipping each BPM with a dedicated two-dimensional calibration platform remains a widespread practical constraint. In this paper, an innovative online calibration method that synergizes machine learning with beam response matrix analysis to achieve per-BPM K-factor determination is introduced. The preliminary beam experiments have been carried out at Shanghai Soft X-ray Free-Electron Laser (SXFEL) facility. The proposed method offers a robust and resource-efficient calibration solution, particularly advantageous for cavity BPM systems where conventional approaches such as theoretical calculation and offline wire scanning, fail to provide reliable results.J. , Shanghai Advanced Research InstituteL.

The sensor unit uses two capacitive probes at a distance of 20 cm, the entire geometry is about 40 cm long. The compact size allowed the unit to be installed in the main beamline, making it possible to measure and monitor the beam energy independently of the beamline actually used. The probe signals are acquired by a digital oscilloscope and the time difference between the pulses generated by a beam bunch on the probes is determined by digital signal processing algorithms. The unique design* of the sensor unit and the signal processing hardware and software combine to provide accurate beam energy measurement despite the short flight path. Accuracy in practical operation was investigated by neutron threshold reactons. They showed that the measurement accuracy is at least one order of magnitude better than the accuracy of the energy value calculated from the cyclotron settings. The accuracy of the signal processing shows that the beam energy can be scaled up to several hundred MeV while maintaining the measurement accuracy at the tenth of a percent level.Z.

Early approaches used metallic blades based on photoemission from beam tails, but failed with micrometric beams or too high energy photons. They were also unable to distinguish between BM and ID radiation. Newer techniques based on CVD diamond detectors, using charge collection in four quadrants, work well at high energies but absorb too much at soft X-rays or lower energies. Thinning sensors down to the nanometer scale is technically challenging and does not solve the problem of light source discrimination. We propose an innovative method using intrinsic silicon carbide (SiC) sensors, not as a replacement for blades, but as a matrix of photoconductive elements, positioned directly after the synchrotron source, each capable of separately detecting BM and ID radiation.

While Beam Position Monitor (BPM) signals are typically used for precise position measurements, they also contain information about the longitudinal bunch distribution, convolved with the BPM system’s transfer function. To extract the true bunch profile, CST Studio is used to simulate the BPM response to a short Gaussian pulse—approximating a Dirac delta function—thereby providing the BPM’s transfer function. The transfer functions of signal cables and attenuators are also measured and combined with the simulated BPM response to construct a complete system transfer function. This composite response serves as the deconvolution kernel for reconstructing the original time-domain bunch profile from the measured BPM signals. BPM signals from the APS-U’s tuned Bunch Lengthening System (BLS) are analyzed in both time and frequency domains.

In the first stage, the electromagnetic phenomena involved in BPM sensors were studied taking into account different pick-up geometries, dielectric and conductive materials, and bunch lengths. Critical aspects such as beam coupling impedance, transfer impedance, impedance matching, trapped/propagating mode effects and heating were evaluated through numerical simulations. In the second stage, three families of vacuum-tight pick-up samples were fabricated in-house, and their actual performance was evaluated both on a microwave test bench and in real operating conditions on the Elettra storage ring. To carry out future measurements on alternative BPM designs, the third family was specifically conceived and built to allow quick and easy pick-up replacement using ultra-high vacuum shape memory alloy sealing technology. The third stage focused on comparing the signals produced by the Elettra BPMs with those foreseen for Elettra 2.0, and also allowed validation of the in-house developed BPM electronics., , , , , , , , , , , -C.p.A.,  of CalabriaE.

Precise monitoring of the electron bunches in the presence of the more intense proton bunches, which have distinct temporal and spatial characteristics, requires a beam position monitor (BPM) operating in the tens of GHz frequency range, assuming Gaussian longitudinal particle distributions. Two types of BPMs, one based on Cherenkov diffraction radiation (ChDR), and the other utilising high frequency (HF) conical shaped pickups, have been explored as a method to distinguish the electromagnetic signals of the shorter electron bunches (a few ps) from those of the longer proton bunches (a couple of hundred ps) co-propagating in the AWAKE beamline. Recent tests of both BPMs in the AWAKE common beamline have been conducted across frequencies in the range 20 – 110 GHz. The sensitivity of the HF and ChDR BPMs to the electron beam position was determined under various beam conditions, with and without proton bunches present.

To support this effort, a prototype electro-optical beam position monitor has been installed in the SPS. The installation utilises a fibre-coupled laser directed into lithium niobate crystals. As the beam passes a crystal, its electromagnetic field induces a proportional phase shift in the laser light by altering the crystal’s refractive index. Signal readout is typically performed using a Mach-Zehnder interferometric setup, with crystals placed on either side of the beam.

It can deliver an intense analyzed beam up to 100pnA at the target. To preserve the beam quality at the target and to improve the performance of RF cavities and beam transmission, both destructive and non-destructive, fast and precise transverse and longitudinal beam diagnostics (including FFCs and CPOs for phase space and ToF measurements) are deployed in LEBT, MEBT and HEBT section of HCI. The beam energy was validated through the existing Surface Barrier Detector measurement setup. Recently, during 20Ne9+ beam test, we observed a notable energy spread of approximately 1%, which led to pronounced debunching and a complete loss of the necessary signal component in the downstream BPMs. To mitigate the energy spread, slits have been installed at the image plane of the fourth achromatic bending magnets, and it was observed that optimally adjusting the slits can reduce the spread by over fifty percent.

The effect of pulse chirp on the sensitivity of the BOXC is investigated, and plans for optimising the design of the BOXC are discussed along with plans for integrating the fibre-based BOXC into the optical synchronisation network at Daresbury.J. , University of LiverpoolE. . . , University of Liverpool, University of Liverpool; Cockcroft Institute 10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-WEPMO28 03 Sep 2025 —  —  —",

For FEL, the higher the repetition frequency of the beam in the device, the higher the user's experimental efficiency, and more experimental stations can conduct experiments simultaneously. Therefore, there is a trend to increase the repetition frequency in its development process. Therefore, it is necessary to develop relevant technologies for high repetition frequency FEL. Beam energy is one of the most fundamental and critical parameters in FEL.

Direct time–energy characterization, however, is challenging due to the limited resolution of conventional diagnostics. To address this, we apply a tomographic algorithm that uses a booster cavity and a downstream dipole spectrometer to indirectly reconstruct the LPS. A phase scan of the booster cavity adjusts the longitudinal chirp, while the dipole converts the correlated energy spread into a transverse distribution on a screen. An iterative algorithm then retrieves the time–energy distribution. Particle tracking simulations confirm that the method successfully reconstructs the LPS structure. Our next step is to verify the technique on the actual beamline, compare the LPS measured using an RF deflecting cavity with the reconstructed distribution, and use the results to guide injector tuning. We also discuss the potential application of the LPS tomography algorithm developed in this study to non-relativistic ion beams, using a re-bunching cavity and a bunch shape monitor., M. .  10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-WEPMO33 10 Sep 2025 —  —  —",

At the PEER (Pulsed Energetic Electrons for Research) facility at the Australian Synchrotron (AS), we use Cherenkov radiation (CR) generated in optical fibers to reconstruct longitudinal bunch profiles at ps timescales, using a streak camera. This is enabled by proportionality of emitted CR intensity to incident charge*, when electrons directly impact the fiber. Streak cameras have been used to image CR**, but generating and transporting CR in the same fiber is novel, simplifying detector design and light transport. We present bunch profile measurements using this technique and assess its feasibility. We quantify distortion of CR due to modal and chromatic dispersion in the fiber, survey methods to reduce distortion, and improve signal-to-noise ratio. Bunch profile measurements at ps resolution may enable bunch purity optimisation and detection of microbunching, previously not possible at PEER.

Drawing on the experience of the J-PARC Main Ring (MR) 1.3 MW power upgrade, CSNS optimized the analog front-end using a MicroTCA-based RTM board. The initial four-stage passive resistive divider was upgraded to a switchable attenuator combined with proportional voltage division, alongside impedance matching techniques, ensuring stable signal attenuation under high input voltages, minimal reflections, and compatibility with the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) dynamic range. The digital processing is implemented on a self-developed MicroTCA.4-based AMC board, utilizing the Xilinx Zynq-7045 SoC with 8 channels of 16-bit ADC (125 MSPS). The system has successfully transplanted algorithms, supports real-time beam position calculations, and publishes position signals via EPICS.

Under this operation mode of SwissFEL, the output signals of the Bunch-Compressor-Monitor (BCM) in operation after the final magnetic chicane (ECOL) of the hard x-ray undulator line of SwissFEL (Aramis) can be suitably processed to obtain an absolute characterization of the electron bunch-length [1]. This is possible in the ECOL-BCM thanks to the simultaneous detection of the Edge-Synchrotron radiation pulse in two different and partially overlapping spectral bands by means of a pyro-detector and an optical fiber spectrometer. Experimental results on the absolute characterization of the electron bunch-length at the ultra-short and low-charge operation mode of SwissFEL will be presented together with details on the formal method applied for processing the two output signals of the ECOL-BCM [1]., , , , , , , T.",

We propose a novel solution to mitigate this issue: employing temporally spaced laser pulses to selectively photo-detach electrons from the longitudinal head and tail regions of H- ion bunches. This removal is theorized to reduce particle distributions in the extreme orbits, thereby improving beam uniformity and minimizing emittance growth. Our experimental investigation used the LaserNotcher system at the front end of Fermilab's linac. The laser delivers peak powers of 1.6 MW with sub-nanosecond temporal precision. Using this system, we successfully neutralized the first and last half-nanosecond of several H- bunches, which were subsequently propagated through the linac and injected into the booster. Data on pulse width, average height, and temporal spacing over several booster cycles were measured for both the scraped and unscraped bunches. Statistical analysis was done to evaluate the significance of these results. This study aims to assess the feasibility of laser-based scraping systems in future linac designs and their potential to enable higher beam energies with improved emittance control., E. .

A diagnostic system equipped with a Transverse Deflecting Structure (TDS) allows full imaging of a beam’s LPS. However, measurements with a TDS are not always easily accessible and are often destructive. In this talk, we present an application of machine learning in the form of a virtual diagnostic which allows for online extraction of the beam’s LPS based on non-destructive measurements. We present how such virtual diagnostics have been developed and tested for three different accelerators: the MAX IV linac and the FELs at FERMI and SwissFEL. We show how a single, general network architecture and training set up can be used to reach reliable predictions of the LPS for all three facilities. For future work, we show how virtual diagnostics could be further developed to suit the specific needs of operations at each facility., S. . , MAX IV LaboratoryF. .

The DESY's Bunch Arrival Time Monitors (BAM) are state-of-the-art sensors based on an electro-optical detection principle, that delivers information on the bunch timing with unprecedented femtosecond-level precision. Timing synchronization at machine level is achieved through a complex system of arrival time sensors, stabilized optical distribution, and feedback controls. Major advances in the performance, construction, and operation of the BAMs are discussed in detail. Integration of the sensor into the synchronization system, and important global optimization and interplay are mentioned as well. These improvements enabled a synchronization of the electron beam with a world-leading precision of less than 3fs at European XFEL., M.

Ps, a bound state of a positron and electron, posed significant challenges due to its 142 ns lifetime and broad Doppler profile. Achieved by the AEgIS collaboration at CERN, this breakthrough relied on precise positron beam control from a Surko-style buffer gas trap, nano-engineered positron-to-positronium converters, and advanced detection systems. This contribution highlights the instrumentation challenges underlying this success, including stabilizing and fine-tuning the positron beam with advanced magnetic and electrostatic confinement, nanosecond-level synchronization of laser pulses, and high-resolution, low-noise detection systems. These developments enabled positronium cooling and laid the groundwork for precision antimatter studies, underscoring the critical role of beam stability, timing, and diagnostics in fundamental physics.B.
