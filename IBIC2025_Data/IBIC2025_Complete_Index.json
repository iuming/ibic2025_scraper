          "title": "Experience with proton beam instrumentation during commissioning of the ESS superconducting linacIn March 2025, the beam commissioning of the entire ESS linac commenced, supported by a diverse suite of instrumentation systems. This campaign followed the 2023 commissioning of the normal-conducting linac, which accelerated protons to 70 MeV. During the intervening period, the entire superconducting linac and the transport line to the tuning dump were installed. Several instrumentation systems underwent expansion, including the deployment of new position and phase measurement devices, current monitors, and beam loss detectors. In addition, various types of instruments saw beam for the first time, such as ionization profile monitors, fast wire scanners, beam stops, imaging systems, and an aperture monitor. The commissioning campaign culminated in the acceleration of first protons through the final drift tube linac tank (to 90 MeV), the superconducting spoke structures (to 216 MeV), and the medium-beta and high-beta elliptical structures (to >800 MeV). In this paper, we present the initial beam measurements, as well as verification of the protection functions and lessons learned from the experience.T. Shea  European Spallation Source",

          "title": "Measurement of nanoampere beam intensities at FAIR1Like standard beam transformers the cryogenic current comparator (CCC) measures the intensity of particle beams via the azimuthal magnetic field. The superior performance of the CCC derives from a superconducting magnetometer (SQUID - Superconducting Quantum Interference Device), which detects fields in the fT range. This enables for current resolution in the nA range but in return needs extremely careful protection from external influences like stray fields and mechanical vibrations. The CCC therefore requires an elaborated superconducting magnetic shielding and is housed in a specially developed, vibration damped He bath cryostat. We have recently achieved half a year of non-stop operation in stand-alone (closed Helium circuit) mode. The nA resolution has been demonstrated earlier during several beamtimes, in CRYRING as well as with slow extracted beams from SIS18. Among the CCC types, which have been investigated, the 'Dual Core' (DCCC) version showed the best performance with respect to bandwith and current resolution. The DCCC and its cryostat therefore mark a provisional closure of CCC development for FAIR. In this contribution we present the latest results and system status.T. Sieber, H. Braeuning, M.

          "title": "Performance study of Fast Beam Current Transformer calibration in the LHC7Fast Beam Current Transformers (FBCTs) are essential devices for measuring bunched beam intensities in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). A cross-calibration of these devices against DC Beam Current Transformers (DC-BCTs) is used in the LHC ring, but this method relies on assumptions that introduce inaccuracies. FBCTs are also used in the LHC transfer lines, where DC-BCTs are unavailable, making absolute calibration crucial for transmission studies. To allow absolute calibration, the FBCTs are equipped with a pulsed current source to perform a calibration before each fill. However, a systematic underestimation in the calculated scaling factors has been observed when comparing them to the cross-calibration with the DC-BCTs. This work characterizes the calibrator performance, evaluates different algorithms for calculating the scaling factors and reports on issues found linked to processing chain modeling inaccuracies, ghost/satellite bunches, and the FPGA-based digital integration. A revised model of the processing chain improved calibration accuracy by 0.4%, while an initial test of a batch-by-batch baseline in the digital integration seems to explain the remaining 3% underestimation.J.

          "title": "Transverse Momentum Measuring Systems: The Cryogenic Momentatron and the TESS12Photocathode performance optimization is crucial to the operation of X-ray Free Electron Laser (FEL) facilities such as LCLS-II and the future UK XFEL as the initial photoelectron phase-space distribution directly impacts x-ray generation efficiency in the undulator. Key photocathode parameters such as transverse emittance and quantum efficiency are routinely measured to monitor and improve performance; metrics that are influenced by the photocathode material, operating temperature, vacuum and RF environmental conditions, and the characteristics of laser illumination (e.g., wavelength, and pulse energy, duration, and repetition rate). To better understand these factors, SLAC has developed a laboratory-based cryogenic Momentatron system to measure the emission properties of photocathodes from 30 K to 300 K using 200-800 nm wavelength-tunable light. The system’s design and initial commissioning performance have been validated through simulations and error analysis, confirming its reliability for photocathode characterization. We present measurements taken at SLAC, along with complementary data for Cs-Te obtained using the TESS system at Daresbury Laboratory - a similar photocathode characterization tool. These results provide valuable insights into photoemission physics that may be leveraged to optimize photocathode performance and thus that of X-ray FELs.G. Adhikari, T.

In order to accelerate and transport the high-intensity beam to facilities stably, the current value, centroid, and distribution of the beam must be measured to realize optimum operating conditions. This paper reports on the transformations and improvements of the linac beam diagnostics since 2015. As an example, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were employed in the WSM at the upstream of the linac. There has never been an unintentional WSM failure after the CNT replacement. Other reports on the status of BSM operations will also be presented. The diagnosis of beam anomalies experienced during beam tuning will also be reported.K. Moriya  Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex, Japan Atomic Energy AgencyT.

          "title": "Beam diagnostics for IFMIF-DONES: addressing the challenges of high-power irradiation facilities24The IFMIF-DONES facility, currently under construction in Granada (Spain), is dedicated to testing materials under neutron irradiation, as part of advanced materials research for next-generation fusion reactors. The superconducting linear accelerator of the facility is intended to deliver a continuous-wave deuteron beam with an energy of 40 MeV and an unprecedented current of 125 mA. The production of neutrons is then achieved by driving the 5 MW beam into a liquid lithium target. Beam diagnostics play a critical role in the IFMIF-DONES accelerator due to several unique challenges. These include the extremely high beam power, the harsh environment due to neutron and gamma radiation and the required operational availability of the accelerator. Moreover, the accelerator may operate in pulsed and continuous wave for commissioning and standard operation, respectively. This work presents an overview of the main beam diagnostics techniques and strategies needed to address these challenges, as well as the construction plan and the prototyping works.

After a dark time of 15 months from October 2023 until December 2024, SLS 2.0 now provides more than 40 times higher brilliance for hard X-ray users, thanks to an innovative compact 7-bend achromat magnet lattice with reverse bending magnets that fits into the old SLS 1.0 tunnel. In this contribution, we give an overview of the commissioning of the new storage ring and first user operation experience, highlighting key differences between SLS 1.0 and 2.0, as well as the role and usage of different beam instrumentation systems during the commissioning process from the operations perspective. Moreover, we present the status of beam-based feedbacks systems, and the resulting beam stability and performance that has been achieve so far during first user operation.B.
