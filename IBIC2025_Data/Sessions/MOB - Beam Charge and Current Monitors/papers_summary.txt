   Abstract: (CCC) measures the intensity of particle beams via the azimuthal magnetic field. The superior performance of the CCC derives from a superconducting magnetometer (SQUID - Superconducting Quantum Interference Device), which detects fields in the fT range. This enables for current resolution in the nA ...

   Abstract: essential devices for measuring bunched beam intensities in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). A cross-calibration of these devices against DC Beam Current Transformers (DC-BCTs) is used in the LHC ring, but this method relies on assumptions that introduce inaccuracies. FBCTs are also used in the LHC ...

   DOI: https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-MOBI01
   Abstract: crucial to the operation of X-ray Free Electron Laser (FEL) facilities such as LCLS-II and the future UK XFEL as the initial photoelectron phase-space distribution directly impacts x-ray generation efficiency in the undulator. Key photocathode parameters such as transverse emittance and quantum effi...
