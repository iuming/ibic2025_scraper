MOC - Overview and Commissioning,MOCC01,"Current Activities of the Beam Diagnostics in the J-PARC Linac18J-PARC Linac accelerates the high-intensity beam of 50 mA using an RF system of 324 MHz and 972 MHz. In order to accelerate and transport the high-intensity beam to facilities stably, the current value, centroid, and distribution of the beam must be measured to realize optimum operating conditions. This paper reports on the transformations and improvements of the linac beam diagnostics since 2015. As an example, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were employed in the WSM at the upstream of the linac. There has never been an unintentional WSM failure after the CNT replacement. Other reports on the status of BSM operations will also be presented. The diagnosis of beam anomalies experienced during beam tuning will also be reported.K. Moriya  Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex, Japan Atomic Energy AgencyT.

MOC - Overview and Commissioning,MOCC02,"Beam diagnostics for IFMIF-DONES: addressing the challenges of high-power irradiation facilities24The IFMIF-DONES facility, currently under construction in Granada (Spain), is dedicated to testing materials under neutron irradiation, as part of advanced materials research for next-generation fusion reactors. The superconducting linear accelerator of the facility is intended to deliver a continuous-wave deuteron beam with an energy of 40 MeV and an unprecedented current of 125 mA. The production of neutrons is then achieved by driving the 5 MW beam into a liquid lithium target. Beam diagnostics play a critical role in the IFMIF-DONES accelerator due to several unique challenges. These include the extremely high beam power, the harsh environment due to neutron and gamma radiation and the required operational availability of the accelerator. Moreover, the accelerator may operate in pulsed and continuous wave for commissioning and standard operation, respectively. This work presents an overview of the main beam diagnostics techniques and strategies needed to address these challenges, as well as the construction plan and the prototyping works.

MOC - Overview and Commissioning,MOCI01,"Commissioning and First Operation of SLS 2.0, the Upgrade of the Swiss Light Source30After more than 20 years of successful operation, the storage ring of the Swiss Light Source (SLS) has recently been replaced with a new diffraction-limited storage ring (DLSR) called SLS 2.0. After a dark time of 15 months from October 2023 until December 2024, SLS 2.0 now provides more than 40 times higher brilliance for hard X-ray users, thanks to an innovative compact 7-bend achromat magnet lattice with reverse bending magnets that fits into the old SLS 1.0 tunnel. In this contribution, we give an overview of the commissioning of the new storage ring and first user operation experience, highlighting key differences between SLS 1.0 and 2.0, as well as the role and usage of different beam instrumentation systems during the commissioning process from the operations perspective. Moreover, we present the status of beam-based feedbacks systems, and the resulting beam stability and performance that has been achieve so far during first user operation.B.
