   Abstract: mA using an RF system of 324 MHz and 972 MHz. In order to accelerate and transport the high-intensity beam to facilities stably, the current value, centroid, and distribution of the beam must be measured to realize optimum operating conditions. This paper reports on the transformations and improveme...

   DOI: https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-MOCI01
   Abstract: successful operation, the storage ring of the Swiss Light Source (SLS) has recently been replaced with a new diffraction-limited storage ring (DLSR) called SLS 2.0. After a dark time of 15 months from October 2023 until December 2024, SLS 2.0 now provides more than 40 times higher brilliance for har...
