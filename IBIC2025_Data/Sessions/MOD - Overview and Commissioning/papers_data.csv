MOD - Overview and Commissioning,MODC01,"The BI system design and preliminary tests for HIAFHigh Intensity heavy ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF）is now under equipment tests and about to deliver multiple beam species from Proton (9.3 GeV, 6E12 ppp) to Uranium (835 MeV, 2E11 ppp) into various experimental terminals. Undoubtedly, it demands a lot of functions and challenges for BI system both in instruments and electronics. This BI system totally possesses more than 650 number and 20 types of monitors, including nearly 300 scintillators for the fast loss determination of primary beams and field emitted X-ray by cavities, and more than 2000 units and 20 kinds of fully self-developed electronics for data acquisitions as well. The system design and deployment details, problems encountered like EMI during preliminary tests, and progress of beam commissioning at MEBT now are all about to be described. As for the monitors, we have mainly designed cold buttons, capacitive and linear-cut BPMs for beam position and phase, various CTs and faraday cup for beam current, IPM and wire scanner for transverse profiles, WCM and fast faraday cup for the bunch length, collimator and halo ring for beam scraping, and many pickups for extraction, Schottky, tune and feedback applications as well.H.

MOD - Overview and Commissioning,MODC02,"Performance analysis of the LHC BSRL and possible improvements35The Beam Synchrotron Radiation Longitudinal density monitor (BSRL) at the LHC leverages time-correlated single-photon counting to provide high-dynamic-range measurements of the relative charges in each RF bucket with a time resolution of 50 ps. These measurements are needed for the operation of the LHC as well as for the luminosity calibration required by the LHC Experiments. In this work we identify sources of error for each the BSRL components. These components are the optics (mirrors, filters and optical fibres), the detector (a hybrid photomultiplier - HPM), the electronics (a Time to Digital Converter - TDC) and some data analysis used for the final results. Knowledge of the errors of the BSRL is crucially important as any errors are passed directly into the luminosity calibration of the LHC experiments. We quantify the errors introduced by each of these parts and for external systems, like the LHC timing. For the largest contributors to the overall error, we propose mitigation strategies that can be deployed in the short term.A.

MOD - Overview and Commissioning,MODI01,"The Role of Beam Diagnostics during APS-U Commissioning40The Advanced Photon Source Upgrade (APS-U) represents the latest advancement in ultra-low emittance storage ring light sources. Since its commissioning and the commencement of user operations in 2024, APS-U has successfully reached its design beam current of 200 mA and operates reliably for user experiments. The diagnostic systems have been integral to the successful commissioning and operation of the machine. This paper presents the beam commissioning results of various diagnostic systems in the APS-U storage ring, with a focus on beam position monitors. Additionally, we will discuss various beam measurements, including beam current and lifetime, tune, beam stability, and swap-out injection bunch motion.W.
