   DOI: https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-MODC02
   Abstract: monitor (BSRL) at the LHC leverages time-correlated single-photon counting to provide high-dynamic-range measurements of the relative charges in each RF bucket with a time resolution of 50 ps. These measurements are needed for the operation of the LHC as well as for the luminosity calibration requir...

   DOI: https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-MODI01
   Abstract: latest advancement in ultra-low emittance storage ring light sources. Since its commissioning and the commencement of user operations in 2024, APS-U has successfully reached its design beam current of 200 mA and operates reliably for user experiments. The diagnostic systems have been integral to the...
