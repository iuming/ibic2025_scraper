MOPCO - Monday Poster Session,MOPCO01,End to end simulations of a novel optical fibre monitoring system for energy recovery LINACs46Energy recovery LINACs,A. Jones; Eley; Welsch,Cockcroft Institute,"(ERLs) are a type of novel accelerator, which recycle energy from old beams to new beams to increase machine energy efficiency. However, this can heighten beam instabilities, which limits the maximum beam current and increases beam losses. An optical fibre beam loss monitor (OBLM) can provide rapid and reliable beam loss monitoring, which is important for mitigating these instabilities. It obtains the beam loss location via time-of-flight analysis of Cherenkov radiation (CR) produced in optical fibres by relativistic particle showers from beam loss events. Operational demonstration of the OBLM system has previously been shown at several non-ERL facilities, but the multi-energy, fast-repeating beams of ERLs present a unique challenge. Successful interpretation of ERL beam loss signals involves distinguishing losses from beams of different energies, which can be investigated through end-to-end Monte Carlo simulations of the radiation environment and its interaction with the OBLM system. This contribution presents Geant4 simulations of the OBLM response to sample sources of beam loss for beam energies of 7-500 MeV and bunch populations of 1-10M electrons., L. , University of LiverpoolJ.

MOPCO - Monday Poster Session,MOPCO02,PREDICTION OF FEL PERFORMANCE USING BPM MEASUREMENTS AND MACHINE LEARNING50This study developed and validated a machine,X. Yang; C. Liu; Y. Leng; Deng,University of Science and Technology of China,"learning approach to analyze the correlation between beam position monitor (BPM) measurement data and output laser power in the Hefei Infrared Free-Electron Laser (FEL) facility. Using transverse position, charge, and longitudinal phase information from 280 individual bunches collected by BPM probes upstream of the undulator, we successfully constructed a high-precision predictive model, demonstrating that BPM measurements can effectively predict the output laser power of the infrared FEL. Based on the trained predictive model, we further deconstructed the neural network architecture to accurately identify key bunches and sensitive parameters that most significantly influence laser power output. This provides a clear and targeted optimization basis for subsequent beam tuning experiments. The data-driven strategy employed in this method significantly reduces the workload associated with traditional experience-based tuning, offering an effective technical means to enhance accelerator operational stability., , , Y.  10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-MOPCO02 02 Sep 2025 —  —  —",https://meow.elettra.eu/90/pdf/MOPCO02.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-MOPCO02,,,

Tzamarias,European Organization for Nuclear Research,"One of the principal roles of CERN’s Beam Loss Monitoring (BLM) system pertains to the protection of LHC’s superconducting magnets against quench-inducing beam losses. Thus, the continuous surveillance of the BLM system’s performance is essential for the high reliability and availability of the LHC. This paper focuses on the architecture of a novel data pipeline with implementations on monitoring the communication status between the 864 acquisition tunnel modules that digitize the analog loss measurements, and the 432 processing surface modules that determine and act upon the criticality of the beam losses. The discussed pipeline replaces an older batch Extraction-Transformation-Loading (ETL) process, which published daily BLM status reports, in favor of a streaming ETL process. The new pipeline expands beyond the daily publication of static status reports by exploiting real-time data analysis and processing enabling the live assessment of the system’s status via online fault detection and web-based dashboards. Future development on the implemented pipeline envisions online machine learning and automated Jira issue generation features permitting fault prognosis and issue tracking., , C.  10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-MOPCO05 03 Sep 2025 —  —  —",https://meow.elettra.eu/90/pdf/MOPCO05.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-MOPCO05,,,

Trinca,ENEA Casaccia Research CentreM,"crystals66Optically active point defects, known as color centers (CCs), are created in the crystal lattice of lithium fluoride (LiF) by irradiation with various types of ionizing radiation. Some of these CCs emit light in the red and green regions of the visible spectrum when optically excited with blue light. When a proton beam irradiates a LiF crystal, a volume distribution of CCs is formed, with defect concentration point-by-point proportional to the absorbed dose for values up to approximately 10^5 Gy. By illuminating the irradiated crystal with blue light in a fluorescence microscope, a luminescent image produced by the CCs can be observed and recorded. A high-resolution diagnostics both for spot imaging and energy in a proton accelerator has been developed based on this technique. Regarding energy, a luminescent replica of the Bragg curve in LiF is extracted and analyzed using a theoretical model of Bragg curve applied to dose deposition, taking into account the crystal dimensions. We report an application of this method to the 71 MeV TOP-IMPLART linac at ENEA Frascati, where it was used to evaluate the beam energy spectrum at both the crystal position and the accelerator exit.E. .

Touzain; P. Korysko  University; F. Stulle; H. Bayle,European Organization for Nuclear Research,"measurements are a crucial aspect of beam instrumentation in any particle accelerator. Often, these measurements must be capable of distinguishing individual beam pulses. In an increasing number of accelerators, pulse repetition rates reach the GHz range. Consequently, beam current measurement bandwidth must exceed a few GHz. To meet this requirement, a wall current transformer was developed with a bandwidth exceeding 3 GHz. It was tested using a vector network analyzer and with an electron beam at CERN's CLEAR facility. Both measurements showed excellent agreement. We introduce the wall current transformer principle and discuss the measurement results.

MOPCO - Monday Poster Session,MOPCO10,The impact of positional inaccuracy on 3D X-ray image quality82X-ray imaging of both material and biological samples is,S. Wells  Adaptix; Eley; Welsch,Cockcroft Institute,"a key application of synchrotrons and laser wakefield accelerators. However, it is possible that undiagnosed beam location offsets can impact the quality of the image created. This is particularly the case in 3D imaging, for which the 3D reconstructions require precise knowledge of the location at which each x-ray projection was taken. This study uses a low-energy x-ray imaging device designed to perform mobile digital tomosynthesis (DT), a modality of 3D x-ray imaging, for veterinary scanning to investigate the impact of this. An intentional offset is randomly applied of size 0.5 mm and 1 mm from the expected x-ray source position, and the quality of the reconstructed image is assessed for both the case where this offset is accounted for, and where it is not. From this, it is concluded that x-ray beams used for 3D imaging applications can have up to a 1 mm error without seeing large degradation in reconstructed image quality.ht be in other modern x-ray contexts, such as within XFEL technology.L. , University of LiverpoolC. , University of Liverpool, University of Liverpool; Cockcroft InstituteA.

MOPCO - Monday Poster Session,MOPCO11,Optical beam loss monitor installed at the SPS slow extraction region86An optical beam loss monitor (oBLM) has recently,E. Effinger; Salvachua; Wolfenden; J. Esteban; J. Kearney; King; J. Meyer,European Organization for Nuclear ResearchC; Cockcroft Institute; European Organization for Nuclear Research,"been installed at the slow extraction region of the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at CERN. The oBLM offers a new method for detecting beam losses at the SPS by utilizing the Cherenkov radiation emitted during beam loss interactions with an optical fibre. This setup should allow to measure losses continuously over a large section of the accelerator, thus minimising the non-linearities caused by the finite coverage of the currently installed ionisation chambers. Due to the high radiation levels and low expected signals at this location, special care was taken during the procurement process to maximise the signal levels while at the same time extending the lifetime of the system as much as possible. The rationale behind the choice of specific components is discussed, highlighting their advantages compared to other options. Furthermore, initial measurements of beam loss during extraction are presented, and the system’s ability to provide real-time diagnostics for beam protection and machine optimization investigated.M. , University of LiverpoolS.

This issue is particularly challenging for low energy charged antimatter, where accounting for charge loss is complex due to uncertainties in their interactions with matter. Existing techniques are reviewed and compared, and efforts to improve measurement accuracy within a tighter error margin than current methods are discussed.

To understand and control the non-equilibrium beam dynamics at cSTART, various beam diagnostics with demanding specifications are required. The KARA booster has been used as an important tool to explore diagnostics for cSTART due to similarities in parameters, in particular the low electron beam energy (50 MeV) and the relatively high revolution frequency. Several beam diagnostics installed in the booster will be also installed in cSTART, i.e. the BPM readout electronics, the Bunch-by-Bunch (BBB) feedback system, the beam loss detection system, etc. In this context, dedicated beam time was used to test the performances of the different beam diagnostics systems, and to prepare for work around solutions in case of limitations if any.

The booster synchrotron is used in a preliminary mode of operation to deliver electron beam pulses of 1.2 GeV energy with fixed length of 250 ns to irradiate cell samples. To enable different spill durations ranging from nanoseconds up to several ms in an energy range of 0.8 to 3.2 GeV a fast extraction from the stretcher ring is developed. Therefore a repurposing of the existing injection kickers for extraction is under study to achieve single turn extraction, up to extraction within a few turns. While the effect on the beam dynamics is observed with a streak camera, the measurement of the extracted beam is performed via current and chromox monitors. For longer spill durations, reaching up to ms, the feasibility of multiple concepts for a quicker resonant extraction at ELSA is investigated., , ,  of Bonn 10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-MOPCO32 03 Sep 2025 —  —  —",https://meow.elettra.eu/90/pdf/MOPCO32.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-MOPCO32,,,
