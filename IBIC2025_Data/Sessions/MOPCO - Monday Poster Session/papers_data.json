      "title": "End to end simulations of a novel optical fibre monitoring system for energy recovery LINACs46Energy recovery LINACs (ERLs) are a type of novel accelerator, which recycle energy from old beams to new beams to increase machine energy efficiency. However, this can heighten beam instabilities, which limits the maximum beam current and increases beam losses. An optical fibre beam loss monitor (OBLM) can provide rapid and reliable beam loss monitoring, which is important for mitigating these instabilities. It obtains the beam loss location via time-of-flight analysis of Cherenkov radiation (CR) produced in optical fibres by relativistic particle showers from beam loss events. Operational demonstration of the OBLM system has previously been shown at several non-ERL facilities, but the multi-energy, fast-repeating beams of ERLs present a unique challenge. Successful interpretation of ERL beam loss signals involves distinguishing losses from beams of different energies, which can be investigated through end-to-end Monte Carlo simulations of the radiation environment and its interaction with the OBLM system. This contribution presents Geant4 simulations of the OBLM response to sample sources of beam loss for beam energies of 7-500 MeV and bunch populations of 1-10M electrons.A. Jones, L.

      "title": "PREDICTION OF FEL PERFORMANCE USING BPM MEASUREMENTS AND MACHINE LEARNING50This study developed and validated a machine learning approach to analyze the correlation between beam position monitor (BPM) measurement data and output laser power in the Hefei Infrared Free-Electron Laser (FEL) facility. Using transverse position, charge, and longitudinal phase information from 280 individual bunches collected by BPM probes upstream of the undulator, we successfully constructed a high-precision predictive model, demonstrating that BPM measurements can effectively predict the output laser power of the infrared FEL. Based on the trained predictive model, we further deconstructed the neural network architecture to accurately identify key bunches and sensitive parameters that most significantly influence laser power output. This provides a clear and targeted optimization basis for subsequent beam tuning experiments. The data-driven strategy employed in this method significantly reduces the workload associated with traditional experience-based tuning, offering an effective technical means to enhance accelerator operational stability.C.

      "title": "LHC BLM SYSTEM AUTOMATIONS FOR FAULT DETECTION, DIAGNOSIS, AND ISSUE TRACKING62One of the principal roles of CERN’s Beam Loss Monitoring (BLM) system pertains to the protection of LHC’s superconducting magnets against quench-inducing beam losses. Thus, the continuous surveillance of the BLM system’s performance is essential for the high reliability and availability of the LHC. This paper focuses on the architecture of a novel data pipeline with implementations on monitoring the communication status between the 864 acquisition tunnel modules that digitize the analog loss measurements, and the 432 processing surface modules that determine and act upon the criticality of the beam losses. The discussed pipeline replaces an older batch Extraction-Transformation-Loading (ETL) process, which published daily BLM status reports, in favor of a streaming ETL process. The new pipeline expands beyond the daily publication of static status reports by exploiting real-time data analysis and processing enabling the live assessment of the system’s status via online fault detection and web-based dashboards. Future development on the implemented pipeline envisions online machine learning and automated Jira issue generation features permitting fault prognosis and issue tracking.D. Tzamarias, B.

      "title": "High-resolution diagnostics of the TOP-IMPLART 71 MeV proton beam using photoluminescent color centers in LiF crystals66Optically active point defects, known as color centers (CCs), are created in the crystal lattice of lithium fluoride (LiF) by irradiation with various types of ionizing radiation. Some of these CCs emit light in the red and green regions of the visible spectrum when optically excited with blue light. When a proton beam irradiates a LiF crystal, a volume distribution of CCs is formed, with defect concentration point-by-point proportional to the absorbed dose for values up to approximately 10^5 Gy. By illuminating the irradiated crystal with blue light in a fluorescence microscope, a luminescent image produced by the CCs can be observed and recorded. A high-resolution diagnostics both for spot imaging and energy in a proton accelerator has been developed based on this technique. Regarding energy, a luminescent replica of the Bragg curve in LiF is extracted and analyzed using a theoretical model of Bragg curve applied to dose deposition, taking into account the crystal dimensions. We report an application of this method to the 71 MeV TOP-IMPLART linac at ENEA Frascati, where it was used to evaluate the beam energy spectrum at both the crystal position and the accelerator exit.E.

A complete renovation of the system is planned during Long Shutdown 3 (LS3), encompassing detectors, cabling, and acquisition electronics. The upgraded architecture will adopt a design similar to the current LHC BLM system—featuring front-end and back-end electronics housed in separate crates and connected via optical links—ensuring compatibility with the LHC upgrade scheduled around LS4.

      "title": "A 3GHz Wall Current Transformer for Very High Bandwidth Beam Current Measurements74Non-destructive beam current measurements are a crucial aspect of beam instrumentation in any particle accelerator. Often, these measurements must be capable of distinguishing individual beam pulses. In an increasing number of accelerators, pulse repetition rates reach the GHz range. Consequently, beam current measurement bandwidth must exceed a few GHz. To meet this requirement, a wall current transformer was developed with a bandwidth exceeding 3 GHz. It was tested using a vector network analyzer and with an electron beam at CERN's CLEAR facility. Both measurements showed excellent agreement. We introduce the wall current transformer principle and discuss the measurement results. Additionally, we highlight some challenges that must be addressed when measuring high-frequency signals.F.

As a crucial preparatory step, one of the 10 TW laser system (Gemini) at the Central Laser Facility is being repurposed as a prototype beamline to de-risk EPAC commissioning and to develop critical subsystems. We report on a progress in three core areas: 1. Targetry Development: We designed and implemented gas-cell targets featuring enhanced durability, leveraging replaceable CVD diamond apertures and modular components to support 5 Hz operation. 2. Beam Optimization: Using Bayesian optimization, we explore tuning of key LWFA outputs—electron charge, energy, divergence, and X-ray flux and energy—achieving improved performance across shots. 3.

      "title": "The impact of positional inaccuracy on 3D X-ray image quality82X-ray imaging of both material and biological samples is a key application of synchrotrons and laser wakefield accelerators. However, it is possible that undiagnosed beam location offsets can impact the quality of the image created. This is particularly the case in 3D imaging, for which the 3D reconstructions require precise knowledge of the location at which each x-ray projection was taken. This study uses a low-energy x-ray imaging device designed to perform mobile digital tomosynthesis (DT), a modality of 3D x-ray imaging, for veterinary scanning to investigate the impact of this. An intentional offset is randomly applied of size 0.5 mm and 1 mm from the expected x-ray source position, and the quality of the reconstructed image is assessed for both the case where this offset is accounted for, and where it is not. From this, it is concluded that x-ray beams used for 3D imaging applications can have up to a 1 mm error without seeing large degradation in reconstructed image quality.ht be in other modern x-ray contexts, such as within XFEL technology.L.

      "title": "Optical beam loss monitor installed at the SPS slow extraction region86An optical beam loss monitor (oBLM) has recently been installed at the slow extraction region of the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at CERN. The oBLM offers a new method for detecting beam losses at the SPS by utilizing the Cherenkov radiation emitted during beam loss interactions with an optical fibre. This setup should allow to measure losses continuously over a large section of the accelerator, thus minimising the non-linearities caused by the finite coverage of the currently installed ionisation chambers. Due to the high radiation levels and low expected signals at this location, special care was taken during the procurement process to maximise the signal levels while at the same time extending the lifetime of the system as much as possible. The rationale behind the choice of specific components is discussed, highlighting their advantages compared to other options. Furthermore, initial measurements of beam loss during extraction are presented, and the system’s ability to provide real-time diagnostics for beam protection and machine optimization investigated.M.

In April 2025, the nominal beam current of 400 mA was reached. In this contribution, we present the status and first beam commissioning experience with the RF System-on-Chip (RFSoC) based signal processing systems of the new SLS 2.0 ring. RFSoCs integrate several fast multi-GSample/s ADCs and DACs, FPGA (programmable logic) fabric and multi-core CPUs all on the same chip. During SLS 2.0 commissioning, the integrated EPICS IOC of the RFSoCs provided bunch-by-bunch diagnostics of dedicated BPM position and charge readings. Integrated DACs are driving newly developed transverse and longitudinal kicker magnets, enabling bunch-by-bunch excitation and damping. Bidirectional multi-Gigabit fiber optic links connect the RFSoC to the event system master, thus enabling both synchronisation of the RFSoC to the event system, as well as real-time control of the event system master by the RFSoCs, e.g. for control of beam injection timing and filling pattern.P.

This paper presents a simulation study investigating the feasibility of a cavity-based beam current monitor (BCM) for low-energy antiprotons. Conventional invasive methods, such as Faraday Cups and MCPs, suffer from charge loss, limiting measurement accuracy. This issue is particularly challenging for low energy charged antimatter, where accounting for charge loss is complex due to uncertainties in their interactions with matter. Existing techniques are reviewed and compared, and efforts to improve measurement accuracy within a tighter error margin than current methods are discussed. This study is motivated by challenges faced by antimatter experiments such as AEgIS at CERN, which aim to probe antimatter behavior under gravity. The preliminary results of the simulation and feasibility analysis of the BCM will be discussed.S. Chandran, B. Rawat, C.

To facilitate efficient information sharing among multiple users, we have developed an integrated system to monitor and analyze beam operations at the RAON accelerator. This system enables real-time tracking of beam transmission paths by analyzing the status of beam dump and bending magnets. Beam delivery times are calculated for each section based on the defined transmission paths, and the data are recorded by date and experiment to support beam usage analysis. In addition to beam tracking, the system monitors and records changes in key parameters such as vacuum conditions, LLRF settings and beam properties including width and frequency. The records are utilized not only used for monitoring but also serve as data for post-experiment analysis, troubleshooting, and optimization of beam operations, thereby ensuring tracking of facility status and supporting efficient management.E.

As the first important task, the injection section will be redesigned and a lot of beam instruments will be installed along the injection to I-Dump beam line. The H0 beam intensity at the downstream of the stripping foil is several microampere during the normal operation, while the proton beam intensity at the I-dump may be over 80mA during the commissioning of linac and RCS. A corresponding design of the ACCT sensor and electronics is introduced in this paper. There are two nanocrystalline cores in H0CT, providing two different turns ratio for the large dynamic range beam intensity measurement. The gain of the electronics is switchable in two ranges. The INDCT is equipped with only one core and the electronics design is aiming to a high SNR for the injected proton beam power evaluation. Tests in the lab showed a good linearity of the H0CT and INDCT sensors with the electronics. Beam commissioning of the injection section is planned in October of 2025.W. Huang, R. Qiu, F. Li, L.

A new RF knockout (RF-KO) with the equivalent power up to 9 kW was equipped at the CSRm for the third-integer resonance. An online ionization chamber was fixed at the CSR External-target Experiment (CEE) monitoring the pre-target beam spot and intensity. A feedback loop comprises the RF-KO, IC and the home-made electronics, was adopted and demonstrated a significant improvement on the spill quality. A pilot experiment with a SiPM based plastic scintillator at the CEE revealed the sub-ns micro structures.

While the effect on the beam dynamics is observed with a streak camera, the measurement of the extracted beam is performed via current and chromox monitors. For longer spill durations, reaching up to ms, the feasibility of multiple concepts for a quicker resonant extraction at ELSA is investigated.L. Thome, K. Desch, D. Proft, M.

      "title": "Status of the source of polarized electrons at ELSA with improved laser and electron beam diagnostics145The ELSA facility at the University of Bonn uses a storage ring to accelerate polarized electrons up to 3.2 GeV. The photoinjector source is driven by a Ti:Sa laser beam to obtain a high polarization degree (~86%) from a GaAsP strained-layer superlattice crystal photocathode. After a prolonged shutdown of the source we restored its status to fully operational and fine-tuned the laser system, the crystal storage and cleaning apparatus as well as the Linac transfer beamline. The in-house developed diagnostic software FGrabbit has been employed for the analysis of laser and electron beam camera images, providing increased precision and dynamic range in the optimization process. The impact of the crystal cleaning process was studied with spatially resolved quantum efficiency mapping of the photocathode surface.M. Switka, K. Desch, D. Proft, A.

      "title": "Development of BPM Electronics for Korean 4th Generation Storage Ring148New BPM electronics have been developed for installation in the storage ring of the 4th Generation Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Ochang, South Korea. Based on the first prototype, two different platforms were utilized for the development of the second prototype. The first version employs an RFSoC-based design, which acquires broadband signals up to 2 GHz using a high-performance 2.5 GS/s ADC, enabling real-time turn-by-turn data measurement. The second version is implemented using a commercial uTCA board along with a newly developed RTM card designed specifically for BPM electronics. This uTCA-based system utilizes a 500 MHz center frequency with a ±10 MHz narrowband AFE RTM card and a 250 MS/s ADC to perform turn-by-turn data acquisition.

      "title": "A Proposed CEBAF Diagnostics UpgradeThe Continuous Electron Beam Facility (CEBAF) has been in operation since 1994. The accelerator has seen several upgrades to RF and cryogenic systems and capabilities. However, the diagnostics used for beam delivery have remained largely unchanged. With several challenging experiments on the way and obsolescence issues with existing hardware, the time has come to explore a significant upgrade to CEBAF’s diagnostic capabilities. The primary focus for the upgrade will be the development of a next generation beam position monitoring system along with a new accelerator timing and synchronization system. Research and development efforts are underway with prototypes for both systems in testing. Updates, plans, challenges and potential solutions will be presented.N.

      "title": "Design of digital acquisition for beam current monitor156As a part of the Proton Improvement Plan – II (PIP-II) at Fermilab, instrumentation systems are being modernized to take advantage of the higher speeds and ease of use offered by standardized embedded systems like MicroTCA. A rear-transition module (RTM) is being designed to interface with said embedded systems. In each of the four identical channels on the RTM, the differential signal from an alternating-current current transformer (ACCT) transimpedance amplifier will again be amplified by a differential operation-amplifier, then filtered by a low-pass topology. The conditioned signal is then digitized at a maximum of 10MS/s by an analog to digital converter (ADC) integrated circuit. After digitization, the ADC passes the data to an off the shelf AdvancedMC (AMC) Xilinx FPGA module using low voltage differential signals. This paper will describe the simulation of analog circuitry for signal conditioning, simulation of digital signal integrity based on physical design as well as verification of design characteristics critical to signal integrity. This work aims to create a methodology that can be applied to future RTMs requiring application of high-speed digital design principles.R. White, J.
