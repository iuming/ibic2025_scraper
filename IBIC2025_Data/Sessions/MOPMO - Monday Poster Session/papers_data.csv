MOPMO - Monday Poster Session,MOPMO01,"Bunch-by-bunch beam current and lifetime measurement with interleaved sampling at HLS159To achieve high-precision, bunch-by-bunch beam cur-rent and lifetime measurements at the Hefei Light Source (HLS), we developed a beam diagnostics system based on interleaved sampling technology, achieving an equivalent sampling rate of 6.5 GHz. In single-bunch mode, amplitude extraction via cross-correlation with a single response function yieds a turn-by-turn current relative resolution of 0.12%. By averaging over 200 turns, the resolution is improved to 0.04% at a 23 kHz data refresh rate, enabling fast and accurate lifetime calculations. However, in multi-bunch high-current mode, large longitudinal oscillations degrade the accura-cy of amplitude extraction when using a fixed-response function. We propose an integration method to mitigate the effects of bunch length and phase oscillations on beam current measurements. The method and experi-mental results provide a practical solution for machines exhibiting large longitudinal oscillations, such as HLS.A.

MOPMO - Monday Poster Session,MOPMO02,"Design studies of a retarding potential energy analyser (RPEA) for low-energy antimatter experiments163Retarding Potential Energy Analysers (RPEAs) are widely used diagnostic instruments for measuring energy distribution of charged particle beams. In this work we will discuss the conceptual design studies of a novel RPEA for low-energy antimatter beams (antiprotons/positrons). Simulation tools such as CST studio and G4Beamline were used for studying the prototype RPEA and to optimize its geometry for considering different parameters such as, beam characteristics, collector geometry, the losses occurring due to secondary electrons and annihilation, grid design etc. The proposed diagnostic can offer the potential for measuring the energy and current of low-energy (1–10 keV) antiproton/positron bunches in experiments such as AEgIS, with promising energy resolution. However, further detailed studies are required to assess its viability for implementation in a practical detector system.B. Rawat, N. Kumar, S. Chandran, C.

The device is primarily intended for measuring the current intensity of an ion beam without the need of intercepting it (therefore not altering its characteristics), making it suitable for online current monitoring.

MOPMO - Monday Poster Session,MOPMO05,"Development of a wide dynamic range and high-precision ammeter for beamline instrumentation at SIRIUS175Sirius beamlines require specialized electronic devices to monitor key parameters of the photon beam, such as position and flux, through the detection of extremely low-level electrical currents. Furthermore, experiments conducted in fly-scan mode usually demand fast, high-precision low-level current measurements. To address these requirements, the development of a wide dynamic range ammeter (from 1 pA to 10 mA) has been addressed, based on a logarithmic transimpedance amplifier, eliminating the need for scale switching and featuring high precision and fast response. The proposed device converts the input current into a logarithmic output voltage and offers two operation modes: the logarithmic ammeter and the logarithmic ratiometer, both of which are particularly useful in X-ray spectroscopy experiments. This paper considers an overview of the device as well as its preliminary characterization and results, including logarithmic conformity, bandwidth, and noise.V. Silva Oliveira, F. Cardoso, P.

MOPMO - Monday Poster Session,MOPMO06,"Challenges with the beam destinations for the ESS linac179For the ESS linac commissioning, twelve extremely compact beam destinations were designed in place of bulky and expensive beam dumps, in order to dump [0.075, 250] MeV protons. The beam destinations were either Faraday Cups (FC) for the NCL commissioning or Insertable Beam Stops (IBS) for the SCL commissioning. Both FC and IBS are beam-intercepting devices, operated under vacuum, water cooled and movable by means of a pneumatic actuator. The **manufacturing** of FC and IBS relied on high-precision machining. The limited installation space and vacuum requirements required strict tolerances, complex welding of small components and vacuum brazing of compact cooling pipes. The **installation** of the devices themselves, their radiation shielding and portable cleanrooms were particularly challenging due to the limited space not only outside but also inside the beamline. The main challenge during the **operation** was posed by the beam power density. Radiation transport calculations allowed to minimize residual dose rates. Thermo-mechanical simulations allowed to define the operational limits thus avoiding damage to the beam destinations themselves and linac components nearby.E. Donegani  European Spallation SourceA.

MOPMO - Monday Poster Session,MOPMO07,"First Attila4MC simulations for the high-power proton accelerator of the European Spallation Source183Radiation transport simulations allow the design and operation of entire facilities such as the European Spallation Source (ESS) in Lund, Sweden. This paper summarizes three of the first applications of Attila4MC simulations to the high-power proton accelerator of ESS and its beam instrumentation. Entire linac sections and beam-interceptive instrumentation were modelled by implementing existing CAD models, relying on unstructured tetrahedral meshes and zeroing out the time spent in manually crafting MCNP6 models. As a result, it was possible to accurately quantify the beam power density within beam-interceptive devices and in turn their operational limits. Activation and 3D dose maps were computed and swiftly visualized in 3D, on top of the actual linac model. This work paves the way for e.g. advanced instrumentation design, linac operation, safe maintenance, categorization of radiation waste and future dismantling.E.

MOPMO - Monday Poster Session,MOPMO09,"Robotic solution for BLM detector maintenance in high radiation areas189CERN’s Beam Loss Monitoring (BLM) system is essential for the protection of machine elements against energy deposition due to beam losses. The protection function relies on approximately 5000 ionisation chamber type detectors installed along all of CERN's accelerators. Some of the areas where the detectors are installed have a high background dose (above 2mSv/h). Installation and maintenance times must be minimised to ensure person-nel safety. For this reason, a new solution was designed that allows the manipulation of detectors and their sup-ports by robotic action. Every aspect of the solution has been designed to reduce intervention time, using a rapid locking mechanism and the possibility of transporting the material by robot. The paper presents the design, prototype characterisation results, identified issues, and mitigation methods developed for the automated manipulation of these detectors.W. Vigano, M. Di Castro, S.

MOPMO - Monday Poster Session,MOPMO10,"Performance of the Cryogenic Beam Loss Monitors Developed at the LHC192Several systems protect the superconducting magnets of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which operate at -271.3C. The Beam Loss Monitoring (BLM) system is critical for detecting lost particles around the machine and reacting on their quantity and associated energy. It protects the machine from quenching and irreversible damage. To measure these losses, various detectors are used, primarily ionisation chambers (IC), but also other types of monitors depending on loss intensity. In injection and extraction areas, additional fast polycrystalline Chemical Vapor Deposition (pCVD) diamond detectors measure time structured losses. To increase sensitivity, a new detector, the cryogenic Beam Loss Monitor (CryoBLM), based on pCVD, was developed. It is mounted inside the cryostat between two superconducting magnets in the vicinity of the beam pipes and operates at cryogenic temperatures. Two CryoBLM locations in the LHC target different loss scenarios: betatron halo cleaning and luminosity losses from the CMS physics debris. This contribution presents the CryoBLM performance and comparisons with other detectors.B. Salvachua, C. Zamantzas, E. Effinger, J. Storey, J. Meyer, S.

MOPMO - Monday Poster Session,MOPMO12,"Optimization of beam intensity measurement system of HIPA at PSI200Beam intensity measurement of high intensity proton accelerator at PSI mainly consists of several passive cavity type monitors and corresponding electronics. New VME based electronics are running in parallel for final online testing with the old CAMAC ones, which will be replaced soon. The new pre-amplifier of the VME system is suffering significant temperature-dependent drift, leading to an inaccurate measurement. Further, wrong transmission rate may lead to unexpected interlock and beam losses during operation. To address this issue many temperature compensation schemes were considered, numerous lab tests were conducted, eventually reach a temperature stabilization solution. Experimental validation demonstrates a factor of 4 reduction in temperature-induced measurement variance compared to previous implementation, achieving a temperature coefficient 166 ppm/degree for RF test signal. Furthermore, the new electronics incorporate a phase measurement of the 50.6 MHz proton bunches for beam energy monitoring. Beam tests show energy measurement consistency within ±0.15%.

MOPMO - Monday Poster Session,MOPMO13,"Intelligent Retrieval Systems for Accelerator Physics: Matching Retrieval Approaches to Use Cases204Accelerator facilities generate diverse documentation, from technical reports to structured wikis and semi-structured logbooks, which complicates efficient knowledge access. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a path toward intelligent operator assistants, no single method is universally optimal. We present three use cases from PSI: for technical documentation, naive dense retrieval with summarization provides fast and interpretable access; for the AcceleratorWiki, a graph-augmented approach improves reasoning over hierarchies and cross-references; and for ELOG, an agentic pipeline with specialized agents supports multimodal interpretation, temporal reasoning, and iterative refinement.

MOPMO - Monday Poster Session,MOPMO16,"Joint analysis of beam loss and beam position during the injection process at Hefei light source215The Hefei Light Source is a synchrotron radiation facility operating in the vacuum ultraviolet and soft X-ray regions. If the evolution of beam parameters and beam loss during the injection transient process can be observed synchronously, analyzing their correlation can provide more quantitative guidance for further optimizing the injection process. To achieve this goal, a monitoring system capable of synchronously capturing the 3D position of each bunch and rapid beam loss has been established at the Hefei Light Source. Experiments investigated both TOP-UP injection and empty-ring injection processes. Thanks to the unique multi-parameter synchronous diagnosis capability of this system, some previously unnoticed special phenomena have been captured, and a deeper analysis of the correlation between bunch parameters can be conducted. TOP-UP mode exhibited maximum beam loss in the injected bunch, with secondary losses at the 14th subsequent bunch. Peak beam loss occurred immediately after injection in both modes, followed by rapid attenuation within several turns. Loss resurgence appeared after ~85 turns (TOP-UP) or 180 turns (empty ring), followed by oscillatory decay.Y.

The precise and reliable measurement of the neutron flux is not only relevant for the safe operation of nuclear reactors, but also for future reactor experiments essential for progressing the technology. In the presented work, simulations were performed using MCNP-6.3 to investigate the effects of various common reactor materials in different shield geometries on the performance of benchmark detectors. This was performed using a validated simulation of a 1 Ci Am/Be neutron source located at the University of Liverpool for a detailed experiment to simulation evaluation. The use of a conical shield/reflector material around the detector showed lower efficiency for the detection of thermal neutrons, and higher efficiency for the detection of fast neutrons when compared to the results for no additional material. The tailored measurement of neutrons of specific energies is highly relevant for reactor experiments on innovative technologies.A. Jones, A. Detkina, B. Merk  University of LiverpoolC.

A 20 mA electron beam with a bunch charge of 500 pC will be accelerated to 7 MeV by the booster and injected into the ERL. To deliver the beam to the ERL loop, a three-dipole merger with variable momentum compaction has been selected. At this energy, emittance growth is dominated by space charge effects, imposing strict constraints on the beam transport and diagnostic design. This study presents the design and optimisation of the diagnostic layout within the merger, taking into account instrumentation requirements, spatial constraints, and beam dynamics considerations.

Aging facilities such as LANSCE face an increased rate of equipment failures, resulting in costly unscheduled shutdowns for maintenance. Early identification and localization of problems along the accelerator can mitigate future failures during scheduled maintenance periods rather than emergency shutdowns. This approach will significantly enhance the facility's reliability and increase beam availability for users. We have developed a mathematical formalism to analyze all available data for a LANSCE subsystem and generate signals indicating abnormal operation. The system accounts for hidden internal correlations between various parameters, which the existing warning system does not. We report progress on developing an anomaly detection system for LANSCE by expanding predictions to all subsystems, increase LANSCE's data archiving capability by an order of magnitude, and developing algorithms to provide operators with signals indicating developing abnormalities and pinpointing problematic beamline elements.N.

Installed in late 2024, these are the first devices tested at the facility. The goal is to condition the structures for stable operation at gradients of 100 MV/m. The maximum gradient is limited by electrical breakdown—vacuum arc formation under high electric fields—which interrupts RF transmission and can damage the structure. To study breakdown dynamics and validate models of their initiation, detailed, time-resolved charge measurements are needed. Faraday cups upstream and downstream, combined with high-performance 5 GS/s, 12-bit, 3 GHz FEB digitisers, enable precise characterisation of both dark and breakdown current emissions. Fast digitiser readout allows continuous acquisition at the 400 Hz repetition rate, capturing breakdown events and several hundred preceding pulses.

A wall Current Monitor (WCM) is a choice of non-destructive intensity monitor to evaluate the circulating proton beams from 3 MeV (about 1MHz in revolution frequency) to 12 MeV(about 2MHz in revolution frequency) in the FETS-FFA test ring. As the beam orbit shifts radially with beam energy in FFAs, the aperture of FETS-FFA WCM will be about 700mm horizontally. The maximum mean circulating beam current is about 100mA and tomographic and Schottky measurements require a bandwidth of 370MHz (100 harmonics). This is a challenge for such a large monitor. A half-width demonstration WCM (demo-WCM) was designed and manufactured to benchmark numerical simulations and to understand monitor responses. Whilst measured frequency band was lower than expected, 1% intensity resolution was achieved in the demo-WCM.

Combination of such characteristics opens an opportunity for cutting-edge high-resolution industrial imaging of dense materials: battery packs, historical artifacts and dynamic processes: crack propagation, motor engines running.

MOPMO - Monday Poster Session,MOPMO42,"Measuring the effects of fast beam loss on the Advanced Photon Source Upgrade storage ring collimators286The Advanced Photon Source Upgrade (APS-U) storage-ring (SR) is equipped with five horizontal collimators used to intercept 6-GeV electrons during fast whole-beam aborts and protect the rest of the SR. The collimators are located in sectors 37, 38, 39, 40, and 1. A fan-out kicker (FOK) system has been installed to reduce damage to the collimators during whole-beam loss events. Since APS-U began commissioning in April 2024, dozen of these events have taken place; in most, but not all cases, the FOK system has worked properly. Turn-by-turn beam position monitors provide beam centroid dynamics data during the loss events; however, limited diagnostics prevent in situ evaluation of the collimator beam-facing jaw surfaces. During maintenance periods in August 2024 as well as January and May 2025, some of the collimators were extracted from the vacuum chamber and examined. Faint beam strike damage was observed on the S01 collimator jaw, but more significant effects were seen on the S38 jaw. Measurements of beam motion during fast aborts is presented as well as microscopy images of the S38 damage. Coupled simulations results are compared with observations.J. Dooling, A. Dick, M.

MOPMO - Monday Poster Session,MOPMO43,"Beam loss measurements during Injection into the Advanced Photon Source Upgrade storage ring290A fiber-optic (FO) beam loss montior (BLM) system, installed along the booster to storage ring (BTS) trasnport line has been useful in identifying loss locations employing time-of-flight (TOF) analysis. The BTS BLM TOF system is comprised of a pair of rad-hard, fused-silica FO cables running along either side of the BTS line at beam elevation. In the initial configuration, we measured losses at both the upstream (US) and downstream (DS) ends of the FO cable pair. However, losses further DS along the septum and injection kicker set are also of interest. We therefore added a 20-m-length, multi-strand fused-silica FO cable bundle, replacing the DS outer FO radiator input. Thus, three of the detectors are configured at the US end of their respective FO radiators. The US detector location provides lower signal but improved spatial resolution over the DS. Loss location identification has been accomplished by inserting YAG screen flags at different positions along the BTS. We present results from studies and operations.J. Dooling, A. Brill, J.

MOPMO - Monday Poster Session,MOPMO45,"Fermilab PIP-II machine protection system digitized data noise elimination scheme and its FPGA implementation294In Fermilab's PIP-II machine protection system, beam loss signals from various detectors are digitized at 125 MS/s. Noise from both high-frequency sources and low-frequency 60 Hz AC power equipment can contaminate the data. To suppress noise across these ranges—especially 60 Hz and its harmonics, which overlap with beam loss signal frequencies—advanced digital processing beyond standard filtering is required. Several real-time functional blocks were simulated and tested on an FPGA: (1) a dual time-constant discharging integrator filter, (2) a de-ripple baseline extraction and storage block, and (3) a fast-recovery discharging integrator. The nonlinear IIR integrator filter removes high-frequency noise and feeds into the baseline extractor. Upon detecting abrupt beam loss, it switches to a longer time constant to prevent baseline distortion. The de-ripple block calculates a valid baseline by averaging over multiple 60 Hz periods, storing results in a 4096-word FPGA RAM. This baseline is subtracted from raw data before integration by the fast-recovery block, which resets quickly after use. All blocks achieved expected performance and were successfully implemented on a low-cost FPGA.J. Wu, A.
