   Abstract: ring have been conducted as part of the ISIS-II proposal for a new high-power spallation neutron source. Beam stacking has been proposed to overcome space-charge limits in an FFA, and the feasibility of this will be evaluated in the FETS-FFA test ring by stacking up to four pulses at 50 Hz. To monit...
