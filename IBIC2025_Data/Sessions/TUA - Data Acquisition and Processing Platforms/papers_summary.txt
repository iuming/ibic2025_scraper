   Abstract: RedisAdapter provides a high-performance, control-system-agnostic bridge between digitized beam data and downstream consumers such as ACNET and EPICS. It forms the foundation of three new software components deployed across MicroTCA-based digitizers: GMMDM, a runtime for memory-mapped data movement ...
