      "abstract": "Excitation at Diamond-II to serve timing mode users308Pulse Picking by Resonant Excitation (PPRE) enables synchrotron facilities to provide single-bunch light for timing users without interrupting multi-bunch operation*. We report the first vertical-plane PPRE tests at Diamond using the Multi-Bunch Feedback system, achieving vertical bunch-size growth and measurable X-ray enlargement. A simple novel optimisation improved PPRE purity by reducing the baseline emittance. Beyond readily-available diagnostics, we demonstrate how crystallographic diffraction can be used as a user-relevant method to characterise PPRE with statistically significant evidence of isolating a single excited bunch. Together, these methods provide a practical and user-orientated framework for synchrotron facilities considering similar timing-mode capabilities. of OxfordA.

      "abstract": "Linac supplies electron beams to SuperKEKB HER, PF, and PF-AR, and positron beams to SuperKEKB LER. We utilize machine learning for both online beam tuning and offline data analysis. Machine learning based on Bayesian optimization has been employed to improve and maintain beam quality, contributing to the enhancement and stabilization of beam injection efficiency into SuperKEKB HER and LER. In this report, we present monitors and beam tuning methods that incorporate machine learning. Identifying parameters that affect beam quality and stability is important, but finding them among the vast number of parameters is not easy. In machine learning-based beam tuning, selecting the appropriate parameters for tuning is crucial, and another important issue is identifying factors that lead to beam instability. To address this, we have applied explainable AI techniques to analyze archived data and attempted to extract parameters that have a significant impact on the beam. This report also covers our data archiving system and analysis efforts using explainable AI., , , , M. , The Graduate University for Advanced Studies, SOKENDAIK. Kinoshita, , K. .

      "abstract": "Beijing Electron–Positron Collider (BEPCII), thresholds on collision luminosity and beam current have been presented due to various factors such as collision background, noise, equipment stability under high power operation, and so on. One of the most serious influences on beam dynamics was beam instability which has been clearly exhibited. The comprehensive experimental investigation of beam instabilities in BEPCII is an indispensable part of beam physics research and can provide references for the upgrade project of BEPCII. Over the past two years, the experimental investigation of beam instabilities in BEPCII has been carried on with the single and multiple bunch filling in the storage ring. With the optimization of the bunch-bunch feedback system, the designed collision luminosity , 1.0x10^33cm^-2s^-1 was achieved during the physical operation and the primary process on configuration of Feedback system will be introduced. For comprehensive understanding the feedback system, a physical model is developed and analysis is conducted to demonstrate the relationship between feedback capability and various parameters. This comprehensive physical model and analysis of the practical feedback system may provide valuable insights into the optimization of the feedback system. of High Energy PhysicsJ.
