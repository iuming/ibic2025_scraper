   Abstract: Excitation at Diamond-II to serve timing mode users308Pulse Picking by Resonant Excitation (PPRE) enables synchrotron facilities to provide single-bunch light for timing users without interrupting multi-bunch operation*. We report the first vertical-plane PPRE tests at Diamond using the Multi-Bunch ...

   DOI: https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-TUBC02
   Abstract: Linac supplies electron beams to SuperKEKB HER, PF, and PF-AR, and positron beams to SuperKEKB LER. We utilize machine learning for both online beam tuning and offline data analysis. Machine learning based on Bayesian optimization has been employed to improve and maintain beam quality, contributing ...

   DOI: https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-TUBI01
   Abstract: Beijing Electron–Positron Collider (BEPCII), thresholds on collision luminosity and beam current have been presented due to various factors such as collision background, noise, equipment stability under high power operation, and so on. One of the most serious influences on beam dynamics was beam ins...
