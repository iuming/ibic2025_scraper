      "abstract": "injectors, critical to advanced light sources and ultrafast diffraction systems, require precise transverse phase space diagnostics to optimize beam quality. Conventional slit-scanning combined with computed tomography (CT) enables non-presumptive phase space reconstruction but faces resolution limitations under sparse sampling. This study introduces a deep learning framework to achieve super-resolution reconstruction from minimal scan data. By integrating beam transport physics with neural networks, the method overcomes resolution degradation in low-data regimes. Numerical validations on a low-energy injector test platform demonstrate significant resolution improvements over algebraic techniques. The proposed algorithm, coupled with beam dynamics simulations, forms a systematic engineering solution for high-fidelity diagnostics. This approach enhances phase space characterization efficiency, supporting accelerator commissioning with reduced experimental overhead., , , , , , , T.  10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-TUDC01 03 Sep 2025 —  —  —",

      "abstract": "a 6 GeV electron storage ring light source currently under beam commissioning. We have designed a beam diagnostics beamline that integrates both pinhole imaging and KB mirror imaging systems, enabling the measurement of beam profiles and the calculation of beam sizes and emittance. Both systems are designed to measure the same source point, with the capability to switch between them for beam imaging. Currently, the measured emittance values are 91.8 pm in the horizontal and 4.9 pm in the vertical. This paper provides a detailed account of the measurement results from both imaging systems., , , ,  of High Energy Physics",

      "abstract": "to transport the beam through the LEBT and inject it into the subsequent accelerator. Space charge compensation (SCC) is a process that lowers the space charge of an ion beam by trapping either positive ions or electrons, created by interaction of the beam with residual gas. The compensating secondary particles reduce the beam potential and the space charge-induced divergence of the beam. Significant beam losses during SCC build-up necessitate minimising the SCC time of pulsed high-current ion beams. To address this, diagnostics techniques are used to study the SCC process and measure its degree or time. These techniques include emittance meters, beam profile monitors, wire scanners, retarding field analysers, and optical sensors. Such diagnostics are applicable to positive and negative ion beams, with unique challenges based on the specific ion beam and residual gas used. In this paper we review common SCC diagnostic techniques, discuss the differences in SCC diagnostics for continuous and pulsed beams as well as positive and negative beams, and highlight the importance of supporting particle-in-cell simulations., , , , , , , , K.  10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-TUDI01 03 Sep 2025 —  —  —",
