   DOI: https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-TUDC01
   Abstract: injectors, critical to advanced light sources and ultrafast diffraction systems, require precise transverse phase space diagnostics to optimize beam quality. Conventional slit-scanning combined with computed tomography (CT) enables non-presumptive phase space reconstruction but faces resolution limi...

   DOI: https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-TUDC02
   Abstract: a 6 GeV electron storage ring light source currently under beam commissioning. We have designed a beam diagnostics beamline that integrates both pinhole imaging and KB mirror imaging systems, enabling the measurement of beam profiles and the calculation of beam sizes and emittance. Both systems are ...

   DOI: https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-TUDI01
   Abstract: to transport the beam through the LEBT and inject it into the subsequent accelerator. Space charge compensation (SCC) is a process that lowers the space charge of an ion beam by trapping either positive ions or electrons, created by interaction of the beam with residual gas. The compensating seconda...
