   Abstract: hydrogen beam profile measurement based on laser wire monitor, in order to further realize the beam emissivity measurement, an emissivity measurement system combining the laser wire monitor and LGAD (low-Gain Avalanche Diode) sensor has been designed. The idea is to use the LGAD sensor to detect and...

   Abstract: developed at the China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS).The monitor utilizes a 1064 nm laser source to measure the horizontal and vertical profiles of a negative hydrogen ion (H-) beam with an energy of 80 MeV in the injection zone. This paper describes the design of the laser optical path layout an...

   Abstract: developed for the demonstration ring of Fixed Field Alternating gradient (FFA) accelerator, called FETS-FFA. From previous studies, Carbon Nano Tube (CNT) wire is selected for the FETS-FFA WSM, durable for the heat damage of low-energy proton beams on the FETS-FFA test ring (3-12 MeV). A bias voltag...
