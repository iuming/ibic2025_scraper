   Abstract: Synchrotron) is a proton accelerator designed to achieve a target beam energy of 1.6 GeV, with a typical operating intensity of 140 kW, which is expected to increase to 500 kW after the CSNS II upgrade. However, a significant current instability has been observed during the 100 kW beam operation. To...

   Abstract: Synchrotron (AGS) at Brookhaven National Lab is equipped with two types of Ionization Profile Monitors (IPMs): ion-collecting and electron-collecting. Ion-collecting IPMs are susceptible to significant distortions in the measured beam size due to the space charge of the passing beam. Conversely, ele...

   Abstract: A new harp has been installed in the Ring To Target Beam line (RTBT) section of Spallation Neutron Source. The harp is made of two planes with 32 titanium 50 micron wide wires each plane. The narrow, low-Z wires versus the 100-micron tungsten wires of the original harp, are to minimize the beam scat...

   Abstract: In the Karlsruhe Research Accelerator (KARA), electron beams of up to 200 mA are stored with an energy of 2.5 GeV, while injection is performed at 500 MeV. At the injection energy, the beam life time and the injection efficiency depend largely on Touschek scattering. As a counter-measure, the beam s...
