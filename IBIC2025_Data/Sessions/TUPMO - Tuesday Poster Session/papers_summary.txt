   Title: Development of a High-Gain Residual Gas Ionization Profile Monitor (HGRGIPM) for the slow extraction proton beamline at the J-PARC Hadron Experimental Facility449We have developed a highly sensitive beam profile monitor, the High-Gain Residual Gas Ionization Profile Monitor (HGRGIPM). The HGRGIPM detects electrons ionized by the proton beam in residual gas, which are guided by electric fields to a phosphor screen. The fluorescence is collected by an optical system. RGIPMs have proven to be powerful diagnostic tools for high-intensity beams because they have non-destructive nature. They have been used as the main profile monitors in the primary beamline, A-line (30 GeV, 83 kW, vacuum ~0.3 Pa). However, the newly constructed B-line (11 W) presents a significant challenge, as its beam intensity is four orders lower than that of the A-line. To overcome this issue, several improvements were made in the design of the HGRGIPM. These include the use of a thin phosphor screen to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, optimizing electrode geometry for higher acceleration voltages and improved sensitivity, and incorporating a high-efficiency optical system. These innovations allow profile monitoring even in the low-intensity B line. In this presentation, we report on the HGRGIPM's design and performance, beam response measurements, and future prospects.A. Toyoda, H. Akiyama, K. Agari, K. Aoki, E. Hirose, M. Ieiri, T. Itaba, R.

   Title: Novel gas jet-based measurement method for beam profile and emittance analysis on the HUN-REN EK-CER microwave proton ion sourceAn ECR microwave H+ source has been built at the HUN-REN EK-CER that targets medium current (20mA) and 35 keV beam energy in continuous or pulsed mode (0.1-10ms @ 0.01-25Hz) and low normalized beam emittance (< 1 π mm.mrad). A new gas jet-based diagnostic system installed on the proton source provides non-invasive beam profile measurement * and allows a novel way for emittance evaluation with an additional mesh to create beamlets. The diagnostic uses a nozzle and skimmers to form a thin (~2 mm) and dense (10e17 1/m3) gas curtain of an interaction cross section of ~10x10mm2 inclined at 45° to the beam axis. A CMOS camera is installed to record the yielded photons (~s exposure time) from the interaction of the proton beam and gas curtain. It is crucial to use a gas that has a high collisional cross section (e.g. Ar, N or Ne) ** and is easy to distinguish from the residual gas (N) excitation to ensure effective detection. This study describes the optimization of the gas jet-based beam diagnostic including gas selection, jet formation (nozzle and skimmer design, curtain thickness and density) and vacuum system configuration. Finally, measurement results are compared with simulations.A. Zsákai  HUN-REN Centre for Energy Research, Budapest University of Technology and EconomicsG.

   Title: Performance of Titanium, Tungsten, and Carbon as Beam Profile Monitor Materials452This paper investigates the signal characteristics of Titanium, Tungsten, and Carbon materials used in a secondary electron emission grid setup at CERN's North Area. Periodic scans were conducted to reconstruct beam profiles and assess the performance of these materials, configured as wires and bands, under slow-extracted 400 GeV protons. The study aims to inform the design and optimization of new secondary electron emission monitor systems for the NA consolidation project and future installations.D. Metin, A. Goldblatt, C.

   Title: Optical synchrotron radiation as a non-invasive tool for emittance diagnostics456We present a robust simulation framework for using Optical Synchrotron Radiation (OSR) as a non-invasive tool to extract the transverse emittance of relativistic electron beams in advanced accelerator facilities. As next-generation accelerators target higher brightness and lower emittance, conventional diagnostics may fall short. OSR, coupled with an optimized optical transport system, offers a scalable, high-resolution alternative. Using the Synchrotron Radiation Workshop (SRW) code, we model OSR emission and propagation through realistic optics, incorporating detector and transport effects. Feasibility of this emittance measurement study was assessed using a microlens array (MLA) system to capture angular beam distributions from OSR. To validate the imaging performance, we integrate SRW with optical ray-tracing simulations in Zemax. Successful reconstruction of the emittance and Twiss parameters from the simulated results in the end validate the framework’s accuracy in optimizing beam diagnostics. The method is benchmarked using beam conditions from the CLEAR facility at CERN, while also providing a blueprint for extending OSR-based emittance diagnostics to other facilities.D.

   Title: Gas-Jet based Ionization Profile Monitor for Proton FLASH Therapy460In proton FLASH therapy the beam monitoring is crucial to ensure the conformal dose deposition to the tumour and effective Organ at Risk (OAR) sparing. A non- invasive real time beam monitoring improves the efficacy as the dose is delivered in shorter time scales. To achieve this, gas-jet based Ionization Profile Monitor (IPM) is developed with potential capability towards real time beam monitoring. It detects ions produced by the interaction of primary beam with a thin (&LT1 mm) gas-curtain without perturbing the beam. This work presents the simulation of IPM to study the ion extraction under different configuration for accurate reconstruction of the beam shape. The role of electric field in the IPM on the trajectory of the ions and the inhomogeneity in their energy distribution affecting the beam profile are studied. The study also investigates the effect of beam misalignment, relative contribution of individual ion states generated due to interaction, and the gas-curtain density distribution. Future work will address configuration required to accommodate broader range of beam relevant to clinical application.F. Thesni  University of LiverpoolN. Kumar, M. Patel, B. Rawat, W. Butcher, C.

   Title: Mechanical design and testing of a magnetically coupled motion system for LHC wire scanners463Linear wire scanners are essential instruments for beam profile measurements in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The current scanners installed in the machine have shown reliability and performance limitations in recent years. This work presents the development and validation of a bespoke motion system for the next-generation LHC wire scanners. The design replaces vacuum bellows with a planar magnetically coupled linear drive, coupled to a custom ceramic in-vacuum linear guide capable of high-velocity operation in ultra-high vacuum. A dedicated test rig has demonstrated the system’s positional accuracy, rigidity, and long-term durability, with over 80 000 cycles completed without degradation. This motion technology will be integrated into the first prototype scanner for impedance verification during the 2025 year end technical stop (YETS) and offers potential for wider application in demanding vacuum environments.H.

   Title: Beam size measurement at SBL in SuperKEKB467Sudden beam loss (SBL) is one of the obstacles to improving the luminosity of SuperKEKB. SBL cause damage to collimators and other accelerator components, QCS quench, and large background to the Belle II detector. It also causes beam abort and prevents the accumulation of high currents. Therefore, it is an important issue to investigate and resolve the causes of SBL events. In order to investigate the causes of SBL events, we measured the beam profile at the moment abort due to SBL using three different cameras and found that the beam size was larger than at the moment of abort due to other causes. This paper summarizes the results of the beam size measurements made as part of the investigation into the cause of the SBL.H. Ikeda, H. Fukuma, T. Mitsuhashi, G. Mitsuka, M.

   Title: Progress on gas-sheet beam profile monitor471A non-invasive photon-detection beam profile monitor using a gas sheet, named the gas sheet monitor, has been developed. Our gas sheet is formed based on rarefied gas dynamics. To obtain a beam profile quantitatively, we have also devised a beam reconstruction method with a response function measurement method. These methods gave a 2-D beam profile of a high-intensity 3 MeV beam at the J-PARC RFQ test stand, which well agreed with a simulated 2-D profile by a particle-in-cell code and 1-D profiles measured by a wire-scanner monitor. As the next step, measurement of a 400 MeV hydrogen negative ion beam at the end section of the J-PARC Linac was challenged. Since a high-energy beam rarely interacts with a gas due to the small cross-section and induces an intense radiation noise, the captured image had a very low signal-to-noise ratio though the beam-induced signal was detected. Through some measurements, it was found that the primary noise was a radiation directly acting on a built-in multi-channel plate of an image intensifier. We will reports the details of these recent efforts on the gas sheet monitor.I. Yamada  Japan Atomic Energy AgencyPaper:

   Title: Exploiting Non Redundant Aperture Interferometry as a Diagnostics Tool for Synchrotron Light Characterization475We recently introduced a novel interferometric method inspired by radio astronomy, utilizing a Non-Redundant Aperture (NRA) mask with self-calibration to fully characterize the two dimensional transverse shape of electron beams from a single-shot interferogram. This paper reports the latest advancements in this technique, including a new data analysis approach based on closure amplitudes, which removes the need for self-calibration. We also demonstrate the method’s applicability to wavefront sensing, and we explore its potential for resolving beam halos superimposed on well-defined Gaussian beam core.L. Torino, U.

   Title: Passive Transverse Beam Profiler for Real-Time Monitoring for FLASH radiotherapy479Real-time beam monitoring is essential for enhancing the efficacy and reliability of radiotherapy. FLASH radiotherapy has shown a strong potential in improving treatment effectiveness by delivering doses at ultrahigh dose rates (>40 Gy/s). Beam monitoring at FLASH is challenging, as existing devices like Ionization chambers face saturation. We are developing an all-optical monitor for real-time transverse beam profile measurements in the treatment beam delivery zone. As the therapeutic beam must inherently traverse the ambient air path from the nozzle to the patient, the monitor passively captures beam-induced fluorescence along its trajectory without affecting the beam. This contribution present proof-of-concept measurements with 10.8–28 MeV protons at MC40 Cyclotron at University of Birmingham for 1 to 25 nA beam current, achieving a temporal resolution of up to 10 ms, and compared with beam size measurements with RCF. The fluorescence intensity exhibits a linear response to beam current, suggesting its potential for dose prediction after calibration. This work also discusses the challenges and potential for improvement for FLASH radiotherapy systems.M. Patel  Cockcroft Institute, University of LiverpoolN. Kumar, C.

   Title: Conceptual design of collision feedback system for the Super Tau-Charm Facility483The Super Tau-Charm Facility (STCF), a third-generation electron-positron collider operating in the tau-charm energy region, will be subject to mechanical disturbances and ground vibrations, which can lead to beam-beam misalignments at the interaction point (IP). Such misalignments degrade luminosity and shorten beam lifetime. To maintain an optimum beam collision condition, the development of a high-performance collision feedback system is therefore essential for suppressing orbit offsets at the IP. This study first analyzes the primary sources of orbit perturbations and evaluates the feasibility of three candidate feedback signals for monitoring IP beam offsets in the STCF collision system from the perspective of detection principles. Finally, a preliminary design of the collision feedback system is proposed based on the STCF's performance requirements.Q. Chen, Q. Luo  University of Science and Technology of ChinaPaper:

   Title: Transverse emittance measurements of electron beams from the superconducting RF gun for high-current operation at Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf487High-brightness, megahertz-rate electron sources are a crucial component of future light sources, including the Linac Coherent Light Source II High Energy project, or the high-duty-cycle upgrade of the European X-ray Free-Electron Laser. The Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf has employed a superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) gun as one of its CW electron sources for user operation at ELBE since 2010. The SRF gun is used to drive the superradiant THz source TELBE, typically at repetition rates of 50 kHz and bunch charges of 200 pC. To determine the operating envelope of the SRF gun injector, a slit-scan setup was installed in the diagnostics beamline after the SRF gun, enabling characterization of the vertical phase space. In this proceeding, we describe the slit-scan setup at the diagnostics beamline of the SRF gun. Measurements of the vertical emittance at 200 pC bunch charge and beam energies of 3.5 MeV will be presented.R. Niemczyk, A. Arnold, A. Ryzhov, J. Teichert, R.

   Title: Development of low density materials for beam intercepting instruments491Materials with a minimal interaction with particle beams are widely used in accelerators in interceptive instruments such as screens, secondary emission grids and wire scanners. Material damage limits are already exceeded in energy frontier and high brightness machines. A new generation of ‘low density’ materials with nano-structures are becoming available at scales of interest for use in beam instrumentation. Specifications are increasingly of use but still with fundamental issues that limit their application. This paper will demonstrate the potential for this class of materials for beam intercepting materials. It will outline the current limitations and ongoing research to overcome them both in the short and long-term.C. Pasquino, G. Aliana-Cervera, R. Veness, S.

   Title: Novel hollow core optical fibre-based radiation sensing technique for medical applications and extreme environments495As part of our search for radiation-hard techniques for beam profile monitoring, we have conducted a novel experiment using microstructured optical fibres, which are known for their extremely high radiation tolerance, filled with scintillation gases, which are also inherently radiation hard. We tested this new technique at the CLEAR accelerator at CERN, demonstrating its potential for beam diagnostics. It shows particular promise for FLASH therapy, where it could offer significant improvements in reliability and functionality compared to current instrumentation.R.

   Title: Upgraded beam profile monitoring using Chromox and fiber optic imaging for high-radiation environments499We present an upgraded beam monitoring system designed for use in high-radiation environments where conventional imaging solutions rapidly degrade. In the presented device the radiation-sensitive P47 phosphor screen of the previous system* is replaced with a radiation-hard Chromox ceramic scintillator and relocates the CMOS camera outside the irradiation zone by transmitting the optical signal through a 20-meter radiation-tolerant fiber optic bundle. To enhance operational flexibility, a pneumatic actuator enables remote insertion and retraction of the scintillating screen into the beam path. The radiation hardness of the Chromox ceramic and the fiber bundle was evaluated, and the optical system’s resolution and fidelity were characterized. The new setup demonstrated stable imaging performance under irradiation, addressing the frequent maintenance issues of the previous system. These improvements offer a robust and low-maintenance solution for beam profile monitoring in demanding accelerator environments.A. Gottstein, E. Kasanda, I. Mateu, L. Eggimann, S.

   Title: Phase contrast issues operating pinhole cameras with low-emittance beams502In the framework of SOLEIL-II, the project of SOLEIL's storage ring upgrade towards lower emittances, preliminary studies were performed to pinpoint the resolution limits of the exisiting pinhole cameras. However, while reducing the vertical emittance from the SOLEIL's nominal 50 pm.rad value to 8 pm.rad, unexpected filaments were observed in the image plane of the pinhole cameras, severely spoiling the reliability of the emittance measurement. Investigations, on the existing pinhole cameras as well as on the Metrology beamline of SOLEIL, revealed that those filaments correspond to a phase contrast imaging of the UHV Aluminium window, located before the pinhole. In this work, we first report on experimental measurements performed to identify the origin of this issue and on our attempts of mitigation using a phase blurrer. We then report on SRW simulations targetting the reproduction of these experimental results and further oriented to predict the impact of this effect on SOLEIL-II pinhole cameras configurations.M.

   Title: Current status of developing pepper-pot emittance monitor for high-intensity ion beam505The experiment to measure the Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) of Francium (Fr) is in progress by Center for Nuclear Study (CNS), UTokyo. Fr is produced via a nuclear fusion reaction by bombarding a gold target with oxygen-18 beam, requiring a beam intensity of 18 eμA or higher. However, the transport efficiency of the current beam line decreases to 66 % when the beam intensity exceeds 10 eμA. To address this issue, we are developing a pepper-pot emittance monitor (PEM) optimized for high-intensity beams. The improvements include locating the camera far from the beam line to minimize radiation damage, achieving a distance 4.1 m while maintaining the position error of 0.13 mm. Additionally, we conducted beam tests to verify measurement errors and found the results were consistent with the measurement errors estimated from the PEM structure. Furthermore, the beam shutter time 0.27 was estimated to be acceptable up to the beam power 1000 W to prevent PEM overheating.Y. Kotaka, H. Matsuzaki, K. Kamakura, Y.

   Title: Evaluation of accuracy and resolution of the electron beam profile scanner at the Fermilab Main Injector509The objective of this work is to assess the accuracy of measurements made by the Electron Beam Profile Scanner (EBPS), which captures the trajectory of an electron beam with and without a proton beam present. The proton beam induces deflection in the electron beam, which is influenced by proton charges. For high-resolution images, the probe beam needs to be of high intensity, small diameter, and small divergence, evaluated using a YAG screen and an optical transition radiation (OTR) screen. Additionally, the point spread function (PSF) will be calculated to characterize the optical system's properties using ZEMAX software. The capabilities of the Hamamatsu Charge-Injection Device (CID) camera and Kimball Physics electron gun (e-gun) will be considered for accuracy.M.

   Title: Pre-commissioning of the wide-dynamic range halo monitor to be installed in the Fermilab MI-8 line513The beam halo can contribute to beam losses in accelerators and is very difficult to measure. With an increase in beam intensity following the PIP-II upgrade at Fermilab, the beam losses are expected to be higher with some coming from beam halo. Therefore, it is important to measure the sources of beam halo to minimize the beam losses. A modified Halo Monitor developed by J-PARC will be installed in Fermilab MI-8 transfer line to measure the beam halo. In this paper, an update on the beam profile monitor fabrication is covered. The updates include the location selection for the Halo Monitor in the MI-8 transfer line, shielding options for instrumentation, initial testing of equipment, and ray tracing simulations for the Offner optics and the targets used in the monitor.B.

   Title: Low Density Wires for Beam Halo Monitoring517Beam Halo Monitoring (BHM) is essential for high-intensity accelerators like the HL-LHC. Carbon Nanotube (CNT) wires offer a promising alternative to traditional carbon fibre scanners due to their lower density, improved thermal properties, and reduced beam interaction. This work evaluates the performance of CNT wires in beam halo diagnostics, focusing on their energy and intensity range, durability, and operational feasibility. Preliminary results show that CNT wires provide better contrast and lower beam perturbation, with enhanced thermal stability under HL-LHC conditions. However, sudden temperature increases lead to significant shape deformation due to catalytic particles sublimating. We discuss challenges in manufacturing, post-processing, and limitations related to wire diameter and density. While CNT wires show strong potential for next-generation scanners, further studies are needed to optimise long-term performance.G. Aliana-Cervera, C. Pasquino, R.

   Title: IPM design and new ideas for HIAFAs one of the most valuable noninvasive profile monitors in proton and heavy ion facilities， 6 Ionization Profile Monitors (IPM) have been installed in two synchrotrons of High Intensity heavy ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF). Among them, 5 IPMs are equipped with the Micro Channel Plates (MCPs) 、Phosphor screen (P46) and camera acquisition. The goal is to obtain the large envelop with good spatial resolution less than 0.1 mm, and also 1 IPM is designed with an anode and electronics acquisition for fast turn-by-turn profile measurements. We also have come up some new ideas for IPMs during HIAF IPM design, like using an optical IPM with a slit to successfully measure the emittance. And also, a compact structure of one IPM can measure both horizontal and vertical profiles have been verified practical by beam experiments. Besides, the bunch length measurement based on electrons from residual gas ionization is also promising, with a tapered high bandwidth MCP working as the current detector. In the end, a novel idea and structure seems possible that using static electric field scanning for 2D profile measurements, and also the RF deflector scanning for fast bunch length determination.H.

   Title: PEPITES: an ultra-thin beam profiler with wide dynamic range for charged particle beams521PEPITES`*` is an ultra-thin and wide dynamic range charged particle beam profiler. Its signal uses secondary electron emission, effective with only O(10 nm) of matter and highly linear with beam intensity. Thin film techniques are used for the sensitive area, enabling multiple monitor variants. Typical electrodes are membranes with 50 nm thick gold strips or fully metallized. Several systems will be presented. A first PEPITES profiler was installed at ARRONAX`**` in May 2022 and is used routinely. It features a 10 µm Water Equivalent Thickness (WET) and two 32-strip 7×7 cm² planes to sample the beam along X and Y, each facing a positively biased plain electrode to collect the electrons. A second monitor is under development with CNAO`***` for therapeutic beams. Its lower, 5 µm WET, is motivated by the long 6.5 m patient-monitor distance and is obtained by replacing the anode plans by off-axis metallic bars.

   Title: Initial implementation of a new orbit feedback system using MicroTCA.4 for the PF user operations524A new orbit feedback system has been introduced to the PF-ring, a synchrotron radiation source at KEK, starting from the third operation period of FY2024. The new system is built with state-of-the-art digital signal processing circuits based on the MicroTCA.4 standard. The stored beam’s closed orbit distortion (COD) is measured at a 10 kHz rate using the circuits matched to the number of BPMs, and corrected to a designated reference orbit by feeding back the results of matrix calculations using the inverse response matrix to the currents of fast steering magnets. The transition from the legacy VME-based system, which had been in service for nearly 30 years, was carried out carefully and stepwise during the startup phase of the third operation period. The reference orbit was successfully transferred to the new system, and even in-vacuum undulators with a minimum gap of 4 mm were operated without requiring additional orbit corrections. In this presentation, we will describe the setup of the newly implemented system, the transition process from the old system, and plans for future improvements.R. Takai, H. Sagehashi, M. Shiozawa, M.

   Title: Electron beam energy measurement in the SLRI 6 MeV Linac using x-ray Scintillator Imaging528The Synchrotron Light Research Institute (SLRI) in Thailand aims to operate a 6 MeV electron linear accelerator for irradiation, supporting various agricultural and industrial applications. This study presents a method for measuring electron beam energy using the existing dipole magnet in the beamline, originally designed for scanning X-rays on samples through a scan horn. An aluminum sheet coated with terbium-doped gadolinium oxysulfide (Gd₂O₂S) was used as a scintillation screen for X-ray illumination and placed downstream of the scan horn. X-ray scintillator images were captured with a CCD camera. By analyzing shifts in the X-ray image centroid as the dipole magnet current varied, we were able to determine the electron beam energy. The experimental setup, simulations, and measurement results are presented and discussed.P. Boonpornprasert, S. Chunjarean, D. Khampiranon, J. Nadeedanklang, K. Manasatitpong, N. Yachum, S.

   Title: Model-based optimal control design for the orbit feedback system at the Siam Photon Source532A model-based optimal control approach has been developed for the slow orbit feedback (SOFB) system to enhance orbit stability in the Siam Photon Source (SPS) storage ring. The control strategy utilizes a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) based on a multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) state-space model of the linear SPS storage ring, derived through system identification using MATLAB and SIMULINK. The necessary and sufficient conditions for controllability and boundedness of the dynamic system are established. Experimental simulations were conducted to assess the performance of the LQR controller in a practical SPS storage ring. The results demonstrate that the proposed control method effectively minimizes the quadratic cost function and error signals between setpoints and process variables for both horizontal and vertical orbit positions while ensuring system stability and robustness. The study also outlines the fundamental principles of optimal control theory, system identification, and future development directions.S. Klinkhieo, N. Yachum, N. Suradet, S. Chunjarean, S.

   Title: Overview and status of beam diagnostics for the injector linac of the Siam Photon Source536The Synchrotron Light Research Institute (SLRI) operates the SPS-I facility located in Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand, which provides synchrotron light for various scientific and industrial applications. The linac injector, serving as the primary injector, is responsible for electron beam bunching and acceleration to 40 MeV, after which the beam is transported to the booster ring via the Low-Energy Beam Transport line (LBT). To ensure optimal beam quality and efficient transport, various beam instrumentation devices are installed along the linac injector and LBT for diagnostics and monitoring. This contribution presents an overview of the beam instrumentation used to measure beam current, transverse profiles, and energy profiles, serving as a fundamental reference for future beam optimization and performance improvements of the SPS-I linac injector system.P.

   Title: Design of an upgraded screen monitor system for the Siam Photon Source injector linac540The Siam Photon Source (SPS) is a 1.2-GeV synchrotron facility in Thailand, operated by the Synchrotron Light Research Institute (SLRI), providing synchrotron radiation for various applications to the user community. The SPS injector linac generates 40-MeV electron bunches, which are then transported to the booster synchrotron via the Low-Energy Beam Transport line (LBT). To ensure effective beam monitoring along the injector linac and LBT, key beam diagnostics—including beam current, transverse profile, and energy profile monitoring—have been installed in the injector linac. In order to maintain full diagnostic performance, the screen monitor system is planned to be upgraded to enhance transverse beam profile monitoring, improve radiation resistance, and support injector linac optimization for higher machine performance. This paper presents the current status of the screen monitor system for the SPS injector linac and discusses the design and implementation plan for its upgrade.T. Chanwattana, P. Boonpornprasert, S.

   Title: A Closed-Loop Photon Beam Control Approach for the Siam Photon SourceThis paper presents the enhancement of photon beam position stability at the Siam Photon Source (SPS) synchrotron through a real-time feedback control system incorporating a fault-tolerant control (FTC) algorithm. The system utilizes Photon Beam Position Monitor (pBPM) measurements within a global orbit feedback loop to minimize beam position fluctuations. The FTC algorithm plays a critical role in ensuring system reliability by detecting and compensating for disturbances, sensor errors, and actuator faults, maintaining stable beam conditions under varying operational scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the FTC-based feedback system significantly reduces photon orbit deviations, improving synchrotron radiation quality. By enhancing robustness and adaptability, the control system ensures precise beam positioning, making the SPS more reliable for scientific and industrial applications requiring high beam stability.S.

   Title: Design of a non-invasive laser-based beam profile monitor system for the new Fermilab PIP-II superconducting H- linac543As part of the new Proton Improvement Plan (PIP-II), Fermilab is undertaking the development of a new 800 MeV, 2 mA H- superconducting RF linac to replace its present normal conducting 400 MeV linac. The PIP-II linac consists of a series of superconducting RF cryomodules from 2.1 MeV to 800 MeV. To limit the potential damage to the superconducting RF cavities, PIP-II will utilize non-invasive laser-based monitors (laserwires) to obtain beam profiles via photoionization. This paper will present the design of this PIP-II laserwire system including the picosecond pulsed laser, optical transport line, 13 individual laserwire stations, laser feedback and timing controls. The paper also describes the signal detection system and operation of the profile measurements.V. Scarpine, R. Thurman-Keup, T. Johnson, D. Krokosz, J. Ruan, A. Saewert, J. Thangaraj, R.

   Title: Wide range low cost digital RF phase shifter546Shifting RF phases is a common task in particular at particle accelerators. Which RF frequencies need to be shifted is highly facility dependent, which demands a wide range phase shifter. The phase shifter presented in this contribution consists of a custom board, that includes a high-performance quadrature modulator, voltage regulators and an 16-bit digital-to-analogue converter that offers an I2C interface. The quadrature modulator is specified to work in the frequency range between 50 MHz and a 6 GHz. The board is combined with commercial off-the-shelf products to provide a software interface and a RF tight compact housing. We present amplitude and phase noise measurements and amplitude stability measurements. At the ELBE Center for High-Power Radiation Sources we use the phase shifter to shift the phase of the superconducting RF gun laser with respect to the accelerator cavity RF field. This allows to implement a feedback loop that stabilizes the THz output power of the THz undulator source at ELBE. In order to achieve this, the beam position is monitored in an energy dispersive beam line section and the gun laser phase is used to keep it constant.K. Zenker, U. Lehnert, A. Rivera Osorio, R.

   Title: Beam Stability with Ground Vibration Measurements at the Korea-4GSRThe Korea-4GSR (4th Generation Synchrotron Radiation Source) is under construction since 2021 to be a state-of-the-art research facility requiring exceptional stability for its electron beam to ensure high-quality experimental data. Ground vibrations originating from both natural and artificial sources can significantly impact the stability of critical components, particularly the accelerator and beamline elements. To assess the potential influence of these vibrations, we conducted comprehensive ground vibration measurements at the Korea-4GSR construction site. This study was performed with the sensitive accelerometer at various locations across the construction site to characterize the amplitude and frequency content of the ambient vibrations. The collected data were analyzed to evaluate the potential impact on the beam stability, considering the vibration tolerance levels of key accelerator components. This paper presents the preliminary findings of our ground vibration measurements, discussing the observed vibration characteristics and their implications for maintaining the high level of beam stability required for the successful operation of the Korea-4GSR.H.

   Title: Development of white beam profile monitor for Korea-4GSR550Accurate measurement of photon beam position and profile is crucial for beamline users to achieve precise alignment and efficient utilization of the desired photon beam. In low-emittance storage rings, however, the power density of the photon beam has increased, making it challenging for conventional profile monitors such as wire scanners and scintillating screens to withstand the high power without damage. Here, we present the development of an Ionization Profile Monitor (IPM) capable of robustly measuring the photon beam position and enabling non-destructive beam profile measurement. A noble gas environment was designed to ensure sufficient ionization signal strength, and a defocusing electrode structure was introduced to fully utilize the relatively large active area of the readout system. Since the magnification induced by the defocusing field depends on the vertical position, we proposed a calibration method to correct for the resulting non-linearity. Finally, we present the results from prototype testing, including the measured position accuracy and the point spread function analysis.W. Song, M.

   Title: Improved design of the emittancemeter for the c-band photoinjector at IHEP554To enhance the performance of next-generation X-ray Free Electron Lasers (XFELs), it is crucial to produce high-quality electron beams with low emittance, particularly for attaining emittances below 0.2 mm.mrad for 100 pC bunch charges. This study introduces an emittance measurement method using an orthogonal dual-slit technique, aimed at enhancing measurement efficiency and achieving the necessary measurement accuracy for such small emittances. An emittance meter based on this method has been designed for a C-band photocathode RF gun at the CSNS campus. Finally, we present numerical simulations to optimize the primary parameters of the emittance meter, focusing on beam drift distance, combined with the motion accuracy of the stepper motor and the expected resolution of the optical observation system to ensure the accuracy of the emittance measurement.W.

   Title: Design considerations of the bunch-by-bunch transverse feedback system for the CSNS RCSThe CSNS RCS (Rapid Cycling Synchrotron) is a proton accelerator designed to achieve a target beam energy of 1.6 GeV, with a typical operating intensity of 140 kW, which is expected to increase to 500 kW after the CSNS II upgrade. However, a significant current instability has been observed during the 100 kW beam operation. To mitigate this instability, techniques such as operational tuning and chrominance modulation were previously used to make the 100 kW beam operate stably. In order to face the subsequent stronger instability, a bunch-by-bunch transverse feedback system is required to mitigate the coherent lateral oscillations caused by instability and injection errors. In this paper, the preliminary design of the feedback system will be presented.B. Zhang, R. Yang, W. Chen  Institute of High Energy Physics

   Title: Development of an optical simulation toolkit for transverse beam profile characterization558The increasing demands for high-resolution beam diagnostics necessitate advanced simulation tools capable of modeling complex wave-optics phenomena. We present an optical simulation toolkit based on the angular spectrum propagation method, validated through comparisons with SRW. For synchrotron radiation interferometer simulations, the toolkit demonstrates excellent agreement with SRW results, showing 97.3% similarity in fringe patterns based on perceptual hashing analysis. The toolkit's unique capabilities are further demonstrated through three key applications: modeling complex mask instead of double-slit interferometers, simulating X-ray pinhole camera with more precise pinhole structure, and analyzing the impact of thermal-induced wavefront distortions on beam profile characterization. HALF's X-ray pinhole camera and interferometry-based dimension measurement subsystem require this toolkit for optimized design. Through its physics-based modeling and wave-optics simulation capabilities, the simulation toolkit provides support for both optimized hardware design and methodology research to enhance the accuracy of beam profile characterization.X.

   Title: Model Enhanced IPM Based Emittance Measurements at the BNL Alternating Gradient SynchrotronThe Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) at Brookhaven National Lab is equipped with two types of Ionization Profile Monitors (IPMs): ion-collecting and electron-collecting. Ion-collecting IPMs are susceptible to significant distortions in the measured beam size due to the space charge of the passing beam. Conversely, electron-collecting IPMs are much less affected but can only be operated periodically to preserve sensor lifespan. In this work, WarpX simulations of IPM operation are used to characterize the measured beam size as a function of circulating beam parameters and IPM operating conditions. We then study the efficacy of integrating machine learning models into the beam size prediction algorithm to generate a better emittance measurement. We consider both supervised and unsupervised approaches. The former utilizes simulations to back out the contribution of space-charge when the ions drift from their point of origin to the collection rods. The latter case uses machine learning for noise reduction to get a better fit of the beam size data.C. Hall, J. Edelen  RadiaSoft (United States)G. Hoffstaetter  Cornell UniversityK. Brown, V.

   Title: Nanostructured targets for advanced beam diagnostics562Transverse beam diagnostics with standard imaging techniques represent a challenge for next-generation accelerators and colliders due to the extremely small beam sizes, and X-ray interferometry offers an interesting method to overcome this challenge. In this regard, the X-ray Heterodyne Near Field Speckles (X-HNFS) technique has successfully been used to resolve few-micrometer beam sizes and at the same time attain a full 2D beam reconstruction. The method relies on diffracting the emitted X-ray radiation off a water suspension of spherical nanoparticles, which however pose several limitations for the full exploitation of the technique during normal operations. In this contribution we report on recent advances in the development of solid targets based on nanostructured materials with characteristics compatible with accelerator requirements. We present preliminary numerical and experimental results on the target design, prototyping and testing. Emphasis is given to the application as a transverse beam size monitor in the framework of the Feasibility Study of the Future Circular Collider (FCC) at CERN.M.

This study focuses on the preliminary analysis of IPM data signals, aiming to accurately extract critical beam information from the signals. Residual gas components in the vacuum chamber were identified through peak spacing calculations. Real-time beam profiles (0–20 ms, low power) were obtained, revealing the beam center and temporal evolution of rms beam size. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of signal peaks uncovered dynamic changes in the synchrotron tune. Single- and multi-Gaussian fitting methods were used to analyze MCP-collected charge over time and determine MCP saturation time point. The results demonstrate that IPM data analysis effectively extracts beam information, supporting real-time monitoring and optimization of CSNS RCS beam stability and quality.M. Rehman, Y. Guo, Z.

   Title: Results from the new titanium wired harp at the Spallation Neutron Source574AA new harp has been installed in the Ring To Target Beam line (RTBT) section of Spallation Neutron Source. The harp is made of two planes with 32 titanium 50 micron wide wires each plane. The narrow, low-Z wires versus the 100-micron tungsten wires of the original harp, are to minimize the beam scattering. This harp will be both a backup and a complement to the existing harp further downstream. The newly created data-acquisition system is also suitable to replace the existing’s harp data-acquisition system, now over 20 years old. We show the use of a cRIO platform as a cost-effective way to process many channels and sample the beam profile at the full 60 Hz beam repetition rate. We also describe the performance of the titanium wires. A passive analog board is used to lengthen the signals to allow sampling at <= 10kS/s/ch. The data is acquired by the FPGA, passed on to the real-time OS, LabVIEW RT, and through the SNS EPICS Channel Access server presented to the control room.W. Blokland, A. Aleksandrov, B. Cathey, W.

   Title: Time-resolved measurements of transverse beam excitation in an electron storage ring578In the Karlsruhe Research Accelerator (KARA), electron beams of up to 200 mA are stored with an energy of 2.5 GeV, while injection is performed at 500 MeV. At the injection energy, the beam life time and the injection efficiency depend largely on Touschek scattering. As a counter-measure, the beam size can be enlarged transversally by an excitiing modulation, e.g. applied via a strip-line. Here, we examine different excitation strategies and their effects on beam size and the beam orbit.
