   Abstract: Monitor (EO-BPM) is a new diagnostic tool being developed to enhance the intra-bunch transverse beam position monitoring in the High Luminosity LHC at CERN. This EO-BPM has been installed in the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) since 2024. The Pockels effect in lithium niobate crystals is exploited to...

   DOI: https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-WEAT01
   Abstract: SourcesThe advent of 4th generation synchrotron light sources has placed unprecedented demands on beam stability, requiring sub-micron orbit control to fully exploit their ultra-low emittance and high-brightness capabilities. This tutorial explores orbit stability, covering sources of perturbations ...
