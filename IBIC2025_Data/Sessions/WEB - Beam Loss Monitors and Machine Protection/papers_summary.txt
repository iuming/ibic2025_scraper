   Abstract: In 2024, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) delivered Pb-Pb ion collisions at a beam energy of 6.8 Z TeV with a stored beam energy of more than 20 MJ. In order to clean beam halo particles and avoid quenching the LHC superconducting magnets, the novel crystal collimation method employing 4 mm-long crys...

   DOI: https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-WEBC02
   Abstract: superconducting upgrade to the LCLS x-ray free-electron laser at SLAC is now in commissioning, as we gradually raise the repetition rate of the 4-GeV beam toward 1 MHz and the beam power toward 120 kW. A further upgrade next year will double the energy and power. Machine protection at this extremely...

   DOI: https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-WEBI01
   Abstract: mechanism598At the SuperKEKB electron-positron collider, which aims to achieve the world's highest luminosity, "Sudden Beam Loss events (SBL)" have prevented its stable operation, in which several tens of percent of the beam current is lost and aborted within several turns (20-50 µs). Elucidating SB...
