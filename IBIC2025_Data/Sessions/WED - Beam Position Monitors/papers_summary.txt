   Abstract: Position Monitors are the essential diagnostics tools in any accelerator facility. They enable precise beam orbit measurements with nanometer-level resolution which are crucial for the operation of modern linac-based Free Electron Lasers and future linear colliders. In this work we present the devel...

   Abstract: such as gold meshes and conductive diamond films, often suffer from significant drawbacks, as diffraction effects, non-uniform transparency, low signal levels, and poor spatial resolution, particularly when applied to soft and tender X-ray beams. To address these limitations, we explore the use of u...

   DOI: https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-WEDI01
   Abstract: In the context of building the next generation of synchrotron light sources, significant effort has been directed towards developing BPM buttons. The design of these components needs to consider several factors related to the miniaturization of the beam pipe and the broadening of the beam spectrum, ...
