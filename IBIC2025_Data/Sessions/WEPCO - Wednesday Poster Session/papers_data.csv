WEPCO - Wednesday Poster Session,WEPCO01,Single-shot electron bunch profile monitor based on coherent transition radiation imaging608The development of,Lundquist; Thorin; E. Mansten; Wolfenden; Guisao Betancur,Cockcroft Institute; Lund University; MAX IV LaboratoryJ,"longitudinal diagnostics for short-pulse electron accelerators is challenging but necessary to provide high-brightness electron bunches. This is equally true in novel plasma accelerators and for free electron lasers. The gold standard for such measurements is the transverse deflecting cavity (TDC); however, these devices are typically invasive and costly to produce and operate. As an alternative, a THz-based reflective imaging system has been designed and installed at the MAX IV short pulse facility (SPF) for imaging coherent transition radiation (CTR) for bunch profile reconstruction. This contribution presents the progress towards applying transfer learning to deep learning models for evaluating the reconstruction of bunch profiles from experimentally acquired CTR images, building on previous successes in profile prediction using simulated data. Practical resolution limits and the next steps in the development of the monitor are also discussed, where the reconstructions of the longitudinal profile will be achieved using single-shot CTR images and benchmarked against the TDC bunch profiles.A. , University of LiverpoolC.

Cheng; Y. Yang; C. Cheng,National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center,"position of the photon beam using four CVD diamond blades. The combination of XBPM and upstream/downstream EBPM readings of the insertion device enables verification of the photon beam’s alignment along the correct trajectory. Significant changes in the beam position or profile, as well as prolonged periods without recalibration, may cause the XBPM measurement data to lose its reliability. Therefore, evaluating the reliability of the XBPM measurement data is of critical importance. By analyzing the deviation between the theoretical and measured blade intensities and calculating the standard deviation of the similarity percentage among the four blades, a reliability indicator is established. The variation of this indicator is analyzed under different conditions and compared with the corresponding Q values., , , , , , C.  10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-WEPCO02 29 Aug 2025 —  —  —",https://meow.elettra.eu/90/pdf/WEPCO02.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2025-WEPCO02,,,

WEPCO - Wednesday Poster Session,WEPCO07,Fast beam-based alignment of BPMs and quadrupole magnets for SPring-8-II630In modern low-emittance electron storage,Dewa; H. Maesaka; Takano,Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute; Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research InstituteS,"rings, precise beam orbit control is crucial to ensure the beam passes through the magnetic center of each high-gradient multipole magnet, with an accuracy of 10 μm or even better. Accurate alignment of a BPM with the center of the neighboring magnet is imperative, a critical requirement for SPring-8-II. With a total of 340 BPMs, efficient beam commissioning of SPring-8-II necessitates a fast beam-based alignment (BBA) method. To assess the feasibility of this method, we conducted a fast BBA experiment at the current SPring-8 storage ring utilizing new BPM readout electronics based on MicroTCA.4, enabling a data acquisition rate at 10 kHz. We varied the strength of a quadrupole magnet adjacent to a BPM head connected to the new fast readout. We scanned the electron beam across the quadrupole center by adjusting a steering dipole magnet. The BPM offset from the quadrupole center was then determined by analyzing data from all BPMs connected to the fast readout. This contribution will detail the proposed fast BBA procedure for SPring-8-II and present the results obtained from the feasibility test at the existing SPring-8 storage ring.

To accomplish this, a real-time, non-invasive bunch length monitor is essential. A monitor is being studied to calculate the RMS bunch length by measuring coherent Cherenkov diffraction radiation with 3 Schottky diodes across different frequency ranges. In this paper, we present theoretical bunch length calculations based on the polarization current approach (PCA) to determine the appropriate frequency ranges for the Schottky diodes. Results show that while higher frequencies are more sensitive to variations in bunch length, they are also influenced by the skewness of a Gaussian longitudinal bunch profile.J.

To precisely measure the transverse beam position during injection, painting, and storage in the Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS), a large-aperture (260 mm × 180 mm) Beam Position Monitor (BPM) is essential. The rectangular cut-plane BPM was selected for its excellent linearity over a large area and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Due to limited space in the injection section, the BPMs must be integrated into the AC steering magnet. To prevent thermal heating from eddy current flow, a rib structure has been incorporated into the BPM's outer body. The BPM was designed using numerical simulation codes and subsequently manufactured.

Adachi,RIKEN Nishina Center,"spiral beam position monitors(BPMs) are expected to provide good linearity and multiple information readouts despite their small size. At the RIKEN Nishina Center, various ion beams are accelerated using linacs and cyclotrons. However, the beams handled are slow enough compared to relativistic speeds, the bunch length is only about the same as the electrode size, and the beam diameter may be close to the electrode spacing. Conventional “diagonal cut” or “cosine two-theta cut” (for quadratic moments) BPMs produce deviations in wave height*. To solve this problem, it is expected that the wave height deviation can be eliminated by cutting the electrode in a spiral shape. Furthermore, by cutting in a spiral shape, multiple cuts can be placed in one BPM, and it is expected that beam intensity, horizontal position, vertical position, and second moment can be read out at a single location.

Commercial products are available in different materials, such as diamond (CIVIDEC, DECTRIS) and Silicon Carbide (SenSiC GmbH)*.

When dealing with monochromatic highly focused beams, diffraction effects could occur. To overcome this issue, a device inspired by Position Sensitive Diodes (PSD) is currently under study by SenSiC. This device, named “resistive-XBPM”, consists of a thin (1 um – 10 um), 5mm wide, 4H-SiC single-crystal free standing membrane. An additional thin resistive layer allows, for the four metallic contacts on the edges of the device, to collect charge which is proportional to the position of the beam onto the surface of the device. A dedicated electronic system has been optimized to have the simultaneous reading of the four channels, thus achieving real-time reconstruction of the beam position without the limits of the “standard” XBPM-type sensors.

The developed device is intended for use at the beam transfer line connecting the KEK injector Linac to the SuperKEKB collider rings. SuperKEKB will operate at unprecedented luminosities requiring very high beam currents. To reach and maintain such currents, high injection efficiency is essential which in turn requires precise tuning of the injection process. The RFSoC based BPM will provide a highly flexible platform for beam orbit measurements near the injection point required for the tuning. One objective is to enable the separate resolution of the orbit of both bunches in the two-bunch injection mode, where two bunches are accelerated and injected with 96 ns spacing. Additionally, we plan to utilize resulting measurements as inputs for real-time automated injection tuning and feedback to the upstream steering in the beam transport line.

We have introduced a new technique utilising spectral interferometry (EOSI), which overcomes this limitation by adding a single optical element to an EOSD setup, with successful measurements shown previously on the CLARA accelerator at Daresbury Laboratory. To further explore this technique, we have performed EOSI on the CLEAR accelerator at CERN (160-200 MeV, 15-150 pC and 0.2-1.5 ps RMS) utilising a nJ oscillator and optical fibre-coupled transport.
