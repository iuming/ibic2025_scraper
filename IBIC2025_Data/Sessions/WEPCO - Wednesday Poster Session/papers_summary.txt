   Abstract: Orsay. It will be the First multi-turn ERL with superconducting RF (SRF) with the ambition to reach 10MW beam operation (20mA beam current and 500MeV beam energy) Diagnostics are a key element for PERLE operation and among diagnostics, the salient feature for Beam position monitors (BPMs) is the pre...

   Abstract: We present preliminary experimental results on the measurement of the current profile and longitudinal phase space (LPS) of an ultrarelativistic electron beam using a corrugated structure at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory X-ray Free-Electron Laser (PAL-XFEL). The electron bunch is streaked by the...

   Abstract: double-bunch operation in 2027, with two electron bunches separated by 25 ns. The existing beam position monitor (BPM) electronics were designed for single-bunch operation, so the two signals overlap and bias the position measurement. To support this mode without modifying the electronics, we develo...

   Abstract: Monitor707Electro-optic (EO) diagnostics offer non-destructive methods to resolve the longitudinal charge profile of highly relativistic bunches without the need for complex calibrations or ambiguous phase recovery techniques. The most common technique, EO spectral decoding (EOSD), is favoured for i...
