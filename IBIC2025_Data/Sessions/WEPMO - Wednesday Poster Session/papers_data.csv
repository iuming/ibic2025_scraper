WEPMO - Wednesday Poster Session,WEPMO02,"Preparing the next phase of the steady-state microbunching proof-of-principle experiment at the Metrology Light Source711Steady-state microbunching (SSMB) is a proposed scheme to generate coherent radiation at short wavelengths from a microbunched electron beam in a storage ring. The feasibility of the idea is investigated in an ongoing proof-of-principle (PoP) experiment conducted at the Metrology Light Source (MLS). Phase I of the SSMB PoP experiment has been using an experimental setup employing a single-shot modulation laser to show the general viability of the idea, and has explored the underlying complex storage ring dynamics. The next step in the SSMB PoP campaign is to progress from the single-shot setup of phase I towards quasi-steady state. To this end, a new laser system is installed at the MLS that can provide turn-by-turn modulation of the electron beam for 1000 revolutions. The main goal of this phase II of the SSMB PoP experiment will be to show bound motion of electrons within individual laser-induced microbunches. In this paper, we show the progress of preparation for PoP phase II, with emphasis on the setup and integration of the new laser system and diagnostics challenges.A. Kruschinski, C. Mai, M.

WEPMO - Wednesday Poster Session,WEPMO03,"Smith-Purcell and transition radiation based charged particle beam diagnostics for the femtosecond-range715We will give an overview of the Smith-Purcell and transition radiation based longitudinal diagnostic methods employed at the ARES (Accelerator Research Experiment at SINBAD) linear accelerator to characterize femto-second long electron bunches. The Smith-Purcell radiation mechanism has been studied for the case of metallic gratings, but not much experimental data has been published yet with respect to dielectric gratings as charged particle beam diagnostic devices. We expect a number of advantages in the detection of the radiation at the substrate side and the spectral properties of the radiation tailored by the geometric shape of the grating structures. Due to the advances in lithographic techniques dielectric gratings can be produced with optical wavelength periodicities and the shapes can be controlled with nano-meter precision. For femto-second bunch lengths the coherence of transition radiation starts to reach the near-infrared to optical regime. This opens up the possibility of characterizing the spectrum with readily available high sensitivity semi-conductor based detectors to draw conclusions on the form factor and measure bunch lengths.B.

WEPMO - Wednesday Poster Session,WEPMO04,"Diamond dosimeter for the measurement of the proton beam impact position on a neutron spallation target718In close proximity to the spallation neutron source of the neutron time-of-flight facility n_TOF at CERN, diamond detectors are installed to measure the fast neutron beam. The detectors are located 2.3 m from the center of the spallation target at 100° with respect to the impinging proton beam. The 20 GeV/c proton beam from CERNs Proton Synchrotron (PS) hits the Pb-spallation target with a nominal intensity of 8.5e12 protons/bunch, a proton bunch length of 16 ns FWHM and a maximum repetition rate of 0.8 Hz. The proton beam intensity is monitored with a beam current transformer (BCT) installed in the PS extraction line to n_TOF. The proton beam position is measured using a SEM grid 2 m before the spallation target. A linear correlation between the horizontal proton beam impact position on the Pb-target and the measured dose of the secondary radiation at the measurement station for each pulse is observed. While the proton beam impact position varies by 12 mm, the normalised dose varies by 20%. The achievable precision of the proton beam position measurement using the diamond dosimeter and the linearity of the dose measurement for individual bunches is studied and will be presented.C.

WEPMO - Wednesday Poster Session,WEPMO05,"Testing of SiC Blade X-ray Beam Position Monitors for Synchrotron Front-Ends722X-ray beam position monitors (XBPMs) play a crucial role in accurately measuring the position of the white beam in synchrotron front ends. Traditional XBPM designs typically feature four tungsten blades arranged at the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the white beam. However, the high absorption and lower thermal resistance of tungsten limit the proximity of the blades to the X-ray source, which may negatively impact measurement precision. This study investigates the performance of an innovative XBPM design that utilises silicon carbide (SiC) blades, which provide enhanced thermal conductivity and reduced absorption. This advancement may allow for closer placement of the blades to the beam, potentially improving measurement accuracy. This experimental setup aims to assess the impact of SiC blades on measurement accuracy, signal-to-noise ratio, and linearity compared to conventional tungsten XBPMs. The results will offer valuable insights into the benefits and limitations of SiC-based XBPMs compared to their tungsten counterparts.C.

WEPMO - Wednesday Poster Session,WEPMO07,"Gain calibration for eliminating X-Y coupling in X-ray beam position monitors at SPring-8 photon beamlines729Although synchrotron radiation originates from charged particle beams, monitoring its positional stability requires distinct technical approaches. To enhance the accuracy of position and angle measurements of the synchrotron radiation beam at SPring-8 BL15XU, both a quadrant-type XBPM and a fixed-blade XBPM were installed on the same beamline. In the quadrant-type XBPM, widening the detector spacing led to noticeable X-Y coupling. To address this, a 2×2 correction matrix was introduced to perform linear transformation of the measured signals. The proposed method successfully eliminated X-Y coupling while maintaining resolution, enabling simultaneous operation of both XBPMs.H.

WEPMO - Wednesday Poster Session,WEPMO09,"Online position conversion factor calibration study for BPM system736Transverse beam position is one of the most critical parameters in accelerator commission and operation. As non-invasive diagnostic devices, beam position monitors (BPMs) are the main “workhorse” in accelerators, providing beam center of mass position information. The position conversion factor (K-factor) of BPM systems constitutes a fundamental determinate of measurement accuracy. While precision calibration traditionally relies on moveable calibrate platforms, the prohibitive cost of equipping each BPM with a dedicated two-dimensional calibration platform remains a widespread practical constraint. In this paper, an innovative online calibration method that synergizes machine learning with beam response matrix analysis to achieve per-BPM K-factor determination is introduced. The preliminary beam experiments have been carried out at Shanghai Soft X-ray Free-Electron Laser (SXFEL) facility. The proposed method offers a robust and resource-efficient calibration solution, particularly advantageous for cavity BPM systems where conventional approaches such as theoretical calculation and offline wire scanning, fail to provide reliable results.J.

WEPMO - Wednesday Poster Session,WEPMO10,"Performance evaluation of front-end attenuators and integrated gain calibration system for new BPM DAQ system at J-PARC MRThe J-PARC MR achieved its initial target of 750 kW operation and is currently upgrading its equipment to reach the next target of 1.3 MW. The Beam Position Monitor (BPM) must enhance position accuracy to less than one-third of that of the current system to mitigate beam losses caused by accelerating the high-intensity proton beam of 3.3E14ppp. To address this, a new Data Acquisition System (DAQ), comprising Front-end Attenuator Boards (ATT), ADC Boards, Network Interface Controllers, and a Data Storage System, is under development. Improving position accuracy relies on improving reflection at the ATT's input terminal and adjusting the gain balance for each signal channel. A self-contained gain tuning system using a self-generating test pulse and an input impedance tuning circuit has been adopted to mitigate the reflection at the ATT and enhance the gain balance across all components, including sensors, signal transmission cables (100–300m), and the DAQ. The installation of the DAQ system is for this winter and the ATT calibration and performance testing are currently underway.

WEPMO - Wednesday Poster Session,WEPMO11,"Design and expected performance of the new BPM systems for AWAKE Run 2C739The AWAKE facility at CERN uses novel proton beam-driven plasma wakefields to accelerate electron bunches over a 10 m plasma source. The facility will soon be rebuilt to study methods to improve the quality of the accelerated electron beam, requiring better resolution from the proton BPMs. In addition, it is desirable to replace the existing bespoke electron BPMs with an in-house solution. Both upgrades will reuse the existing BPM pickups (electrostatic buttons and striplines, respectively) but replace the electronic front-ends and control system interfaces. An RFSoC-based BPM front-end is concurrently being developed for the HL-LHC upgrade, which, if appropriate for AWAKE, would reduce production and maintenance efforts. For the proton BPMs, distributed along an 800 m transfer line, time-multiplexing of both pickups per plane has been chosen both to reduce cabling and channel count and improve systematic errors in the measurements. We present the expected performance of both the AWAKE proton and electron BPMs using the prototype HL-LHC BPM front-end, based on measurements from the existing facility.L. Stant, A. Boccardi, T.

WEPMO - Wednesday Poster Session,WEPMO12,"Digital signal processing improvements of the SPIRAL2 beam position monitors at low intensity743The SPIRAL2 accelerator, designed for high intensity beams (up to 5 mA), needs to evolve for low intensities in order to reach the requirements of the S3 experimental room. This means increasing the operating range of diagnostic monitors including the Beam Position Monitors (BPM). Twenty BPM are installed in the warm sections of the linac to measure positions, ellipticities and phases. The digital processing of the BPM acquisition has been modified to operate at low intensity. This was done by improving the signal-to-noise ratio with an increase of the averaging resolution, an improvement of the channel equalisation system and with a deduction of parasitic signals induced by the surrounding equipment. The process was also modified to operate with chopper frequencies between 1 Hz and 1 kHz. A new BPM interface, with tables and graphical displays in order to control beam phases and energies in the linac, is now available. These new developments and measurement results in laboratory and with SPIRAL2 beams are presented, which show good results with a low intensity down to 1 µA.P. Salou, C. Jamet, S. Rueff, C.

WEPMO - Wednesday Poster Session,WEPMO16,"A compact device for measuring and monitoring the energy of accelerated particle beams752A Beam Energy Monitor (BEM) was developed for the cyclotron of the HUN-REN ATOMKI, using TOF measurements on a short flight path. The sensor unit uses two capacitive probes at a distance of 20 cm, the entire geometry is about 40 cm long. The compact size allowed the unit to be installed in the main beamline, making it possible to measure and monitor the beam energy independently of the beamline actually used. The probe signals are acquired by a digital oscilloscope and the time difference between the pulses generated by a beam bunch on the probes is determined by digital signal processing algorithms. The unique design* of the sensor unit and the signal processing hardware and software combine to provide accurate beam energy measurement despite the short flight path. Accuracy in practical operation was investigated by neutron threshold reactons. They showed that the measurement accuracy is at least one order of magnitude better than the accuracy of the energy value calculated from the cyclotron settings.

WEPMO - Wednesday Poster Session,WEPMO17,"New photon BPM setup using SiC devices in photoconductive mode755Photon Beam Position Monitors (pBPM) detect photon beam intensity and position in synchrotron light sources and are capable to operate in real time during experiments, without altering beam properties and ideally discriminating between insertion device (ID) and bending magnet (BM) radiation. Early approaches used metallic blades based on photoemission from beam tails, but failed with micrometric beams or too high energy photons. They were also unable to distinguish between BM and ID radiation. Newer techniques based on CVD diamond detectors, using charge collection in four quadrants, work well at high energies but absorb too much at soft X-rays or lower energies. Thinning sensors down to the nanometer scale is technically challenging and does not solve the problem of light source discrimination. We propose an innovative method using intrinsic silicon carbide (SiC) sensors, not as a replacement for blades, but as a matrix of photoconductive elements, positioned directly after the synchrotron source, each capable of separately detecting BM and ID radiation.

WEPMO - Wednesday Poster Session,WEPMO19,"Longitudinal profile measurements of particle beams with deconvolution in the APS-U Storage-ring763Accurate measurement of the longitudinal profile, or bunch length, of particle beams is essential for evaluating and optimizing beam quality in the Advanced Photon Source Upgrade (APS-U) Storage Ring. While Beam Position Monitor (BPM) signals are typically used for precise position measurements, they also contain information about the longitudinal bunch distribution, convolved with the BPM system’s transfer function. To extract the true bunch profile, CST Studio is used to simulate the BPM response to a short Gaussian pulse—approximating a Dirac delta function—thereby providing the BPM’s transfer function. The transfer functions of signal cables and attenuators are also measured and combined with the simulated BPM response to construct a complete system transfer function. This composite response serves as the deconvolution kernel for reconstructing the original time-domain bunch profile from the measured BPM signals. BPM signals from the APS-U’s tuned Bunch Lengthening System (BLS) are analyzed in both time and frequency domains.

To support this effort, a prototype electro-optical beam position monitor has been installed in the SPS. The installation utilises a fibre-coupled laser directed into lithium niobate crystals. As the beam passes a crystal, its electromagnetic field induces a proportional phase shift in the laser light by altering the crystal’s refractive index. Signal readout is typically performed using a Mach-Zehnder interferometric setup, with crystals placed on either side of the beam. This configuration currently faces challenges including imperfect pickup matching, baseline instability, and limited dynamic range. This paper examines and evaluates various methods and techniques for reading out the beam position from the phase-shifted laser to mitigate these limitations.D.

WEPMO - Wednesday Poster Session,WEPMO27,"Transverse and longitudinal beam diagnostics and characterizations at IUAC-high current injector792The High Current Injector features normal-conducting RF Linac structures intended to accelerate various ion species with a mass-to-charge ratio of up to 6, achieving a maximum output energy of 1.8 MeV/u. It can deliver an intense analyzed beam up to 100pnA at the target. To preserve the beam quality at the target and to improve the performance of RF cavities and beam transmission, both destructive and non-destructive, fast and precise transverse and longitudinal beam diagnostics (including FFCs and CPOs for phase space and ToF measurements) are deployed in LEBT, MEBT and HEBT section of HCI. The beam energy was validated through the existing Surface Barrier Detector measurement setup. Recently, during 20Ne9+ beam test, we observed a notable energy spread of approximately 1%, which led to pronounced debunching and a complete loss of the necessary signal component in the downstream BPMs. To mitigate the energy spread, slits have been installed at the image plane of the fourth achromatic bending magnets, and it was observed that optimally adjusting the slits can reduce the spread by over fifty percent.

To achieve this, a fibre-based two-colour balanced optical cross-correlator (BOXC) using waveguided periodically-poled lithium niobate (PPLN) crystals is being developed. A fibre-based BOXC could have greater sensitivity to timing jitter between two lasers than traditional free-space devices. In this manuscript, the design of the fibre-based two-colour BOXC is presented. The effect of pulse chirp on the sensitivity of the BOXC is investigated, and plans for optimising the design of the BOXC are discussed along with plans for integrating the fibre-based BOXC into the optical synchronisation network at Daresbury.J.

WEPMO - Wednesday Poster Session,WEPMO31,"Noninterceptive beam energy measurement of high-frequency free electron lasers806Free electron lasers (FEL), which can generate ultra-high brightness rediation are working horses for radiation science research over the world. For FEL, the higher the repetition frequency of the beam in the device, the higher the user's experimental efficiency, and more experimental stations can conduct experiments simultaneously. Therefore, there is a trend to increase the repetition frequency in its development process. Therefore, it is necessary to develop relevant technologies for high repetition frequency FEL. Beam energy is one of the most fundamental and critical parameters in FEL. This paper developed a fusion algorithm based on beam position monitor (BPM) in the dispersion structure of a FEL, which extracts the transverse position of the beam using both the arrival time and amplitude information of the beam, to achieve high-precision and noninterceptive measurement of beam energy.

WEPMO - Wednesday Poster Session,WEPMO33,"Studies of longitudinal phase space tomography using booster cavity and dipole spectrometer813Information on the longitudinal phase space (LPS) is essential for tuning injectors that deliver a few-femtosecond electron bunches to beam–plasma interaction experiments and ultrafast diffraction facilities. Direct time–energy characterization, however, is challenging due to the limited resolution of conventional diagnostics. To address this, we apply a tomographic algorithm that uses a booster cavity and a downstream dipole spectrometer to indirectly reconstruct the LPS. A phase scan of the booster cavity adjusts the longitudinal chirp, while the dipole converts the correlated energy spread into a transverse distribution on a screen. An iterative algorithm then retrieves the time–energy distribution. Particle tracking simulations confirm that the method successfully reconstructs the LPS structure. Our next step is to verify the technique on the actual beamline, compare the LPS measured using an RF deflecting cavity with the reconstructed distribution, and use the results to guide injector tuning. We also discuss the potential application of the LPS tomography algorithm developed in this study to non-relativistic ion beams, using a re-bunching cavity and a bunch shape monitor.G. Kim, M.

WEPMO - Wednesday Poster Session,WEPMO34,"Longitudinal bunch profile reconstruction via Cherenkov radiation in optical fibers817Optical beam diagnostics, such as OTR screens and streak cameras, can overcome bandwidth limitations of electronic diagnostics. However, efficient light collection and transport is challenging. At the PEER (Pulsed Energetic Electrons for Research) facility at the Australian Synchrotron (AS), we use Cherenkov radiation (CR) generated in optical fibers to reconstruct longitudinal bunch profiles at ps timescales, using a streak camera. This is enabled by proportionality of emitted CR intensity to incident charge*, when electrons directly impact the fiber. Streak cameras have been used to image CR**, but generating and transporting CR in the same fiber is novel, simplifying detector design and light transport. We present bunch profile measurements using this technique and assess its feasibility. We quantify distortion of CR due to modal and chromatic dispersion in the fiber, survey methods to reduce distortion, and improve signal-to-noise ratio. Bunch profile measurements at ps resolution may enable bunch purity optimisation and detection of microbunching, previously not possible at PEER. This will greatly benefit PEER users, as well as beam quality in the AS booster and storage rings.P. Pushkarna, R. Rassool, G. Taylor, J. Valerian, M. Volpi  The University of MelbourneP.

Its feasibility was successfully tested at the ELBE accelerator. The design comprises planar pickups on a printed circuit board (PCB) with an integrated combination network. It delivers a significantly stronger signal compared to established pickups. Applying the upgrade to existing machines enables two key capabilities: Reliable operation at 1 pC charge levels for FELs and ultrafast electron diffraction facilities, and enhanced arrival-time resolution for standard operational modes. Furthermore, the PCB implementation enables unprecedented flexibility in planar pickup design, facilitating multi-functional diagnostic capabilities. This work presents a compact implementation strategy for integrating high- and low-resolution channels for EO-BAMs on a single substrate through a dual-functionality layout, and conceptual advancements in beam diagnostics using a PCB architecture for measuring other beam properties.B.
