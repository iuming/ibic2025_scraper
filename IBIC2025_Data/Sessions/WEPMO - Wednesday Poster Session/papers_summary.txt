   Abstract: electro-optical bunch arrival-time monitors (EO-BAMs) employed at several free-electron laser (FEL) facilities, a novel pickup structure has been proposed. Its feasibility was successfully tested at the ELBE accelerator. The design comprises planar pickups on a printed circuit board (PCB) with an in...
